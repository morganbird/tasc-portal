He has also facilitated over 1,000 meetings and developed programs and publications to assist in evaluation and decision-making on a broad range of issues. He has managed and facilitated seven long-term stakeholder advisory boards and designed and facilitated over ten national stakeholder forums and several international forums. His articles, reports, and presentations on collaborative decision-making, stakeholder and public participation, communications, community visioning, and long-term stewardship have resulted in significant changes in the way decision-making is approached worldwide.\r\n\r\nHe has participated in task forces and advisory panels aimed at improving management and decision-making for EPA, DOE and other federal agencies, non-profit groups, the National Academies of Science, and Harvard University. He served five years as the Executive Director of the International Association for Public Participation for which he is also a licensed Master Trainer for the IAP2 Certificate Program in Public Participation.\r\nMr. Sarno holds an MBA and a BS in Civil Engineering. Before founding the Perspectives Group in 1993, he worked five years as Manager of Federal Programs for the non-profit Superfund policy group Clean Sites, served three years as an environmental engineer at EPA in the Superfund program, and worked as a civil engineer on Superfund sites for SAIC.\r\n\r\n\r\nHighlights of Experience\r\n\r\n•\tSenior analyst for EPA OSWER’s evaluation of Technical Assistance Grants (TAG) and Technical Outreach Services for Communities (TOSC) grant programs.  Oversaw process of conducting 48 interviews in nine regions across 18 sites and identified programmatic barriers, strengths and weaknesses.  Based on the analysis, served as lead analyst and writer in making recommendations for improving technical assistance.\r\n\r\n•\tDesigned and facilitated a public participation program and community visioning process to determine future land uses and cleanup levels at a 1,000-acre federal facility radioactive waste site.  PG’s process helped to provide balanced information to all stakeholders, including Native American groups, to overcome a decade of anger and mistrust and develop a consensus set of recommendations for the comprehensive cleanup of the site.  Over 150 stakeholders met in three large workshops to create a common understanding of interests and opportunities. The International Association recognized the Fernald Citizen Advisory board as “Organization of the Year” for Public Participation.\r\n\r\n•\tDesigned and facilitated a future use planning process to engage the public in determining how the 35,000-acre federal facility should be used.  The results were accepted by both the public and the Department of Energy and have been used to guide all environmental decision-making over the past five years.  Extensive public education and training conducted on a wide range of environmental issues including ground water, risk assessment, waste containment systems, nuclear criticality, fate and transport, chemistry, and hydrology.\r\n\r\n•\tDesigned and facilitated a process to determine the appropriate location to dispose of Mill Tailings, overcoming years of indecision in facilitating a plan that was made and implemented.  Mediation spanned two months and involved hundreds of citizens from two Utah cities and several Native American tribes.\r\n\r\n•\tLead a team of facilitators to gather input from nearly 200 stakeholders to help design public participation in the implementation of dredging on the Hudson River in New York, a 200-mile long Superfund site.\r\n\r\n•\tDesigned and implemented an exercise called FutureSite™ that allowed citizens to directly explore options for waste excavation and disposal.  The three-dimensional model allowed a breakthrough in thinking at the site and became a touchstone throughout the DOE as a decision-making aid.  \r\n\r\n•\tWorked with two other experts to create a tool describing the levels of public participation for the International Association for Public Participation.  The result was the IAP2 Public Participation Spectrum that is now used worldwide to help people understand how to select the appropriate level of public participation.  \r\n\r\n•\tRedesigned a course on working with stakeholders for the Fish and Wildlife Service.  Created a detailed model of collaboration to help students understand how the collaborative process works.  The course has become one of the most popular and highest rated now offered and both the Office of Personnel Management and the Environmental Protection Agency have adopted the Collaborative Model from this course for their training.\r\n\r\nMr. Sarno has used his technical and scientific background to create materials, events and programs that allow citizens to not only understand issues but also to provide meaningful input to decision making. He has designed and implemented many information tools, exercises and workshops to enhance understanding and dialogue and has achieved consensus on highly technical and controversial topics. Finally, he has trained over 2,000 individuals in public participation, collaboration, public information and communication, and facilitation and will be able to work with designated Technical Assistance Specialists and Technical Experts to improve their facilitation and public collaboration skills.\r\n	2015-02-27 05:24:47.866213	2015-02-27 05:24:47.866213	282

As a program manager with the center, I have worked with a variety of local, state, and regional/national agencies and communities around such diverse issues as HIV and other STDs treatment and prevention; migrant and seasonal farm worker health care needs; home fire safety and fire prevention; adolescent foster care; Latino/a health promotion; and environmental health. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\tDuring my time with the Center, I have had the opportunity to serve as a project director or coordinator with several community-based academic research projects.  The first set of projects addressed prevention of HIV infection and other sexually transmitted diseases, specifically gonorrhea. In the field of injury prevention, I served for three years as the state coordinator and two years as the project evaluator/community facilitator for the Alabama Smoke Alarm Initiative, which is a home fire safety/prevention project.  \r\n\r\nIn the field of environmental health, since 2001, I served as Project Manager for the UAB’s Center of Excellence in Environmental Health project, “Developing Communities of Excellence in Environmental Health” from October, 2001 through September, 2004. With this program, I became a trainer for the Protocol for Assessing Excellence in Environmental Health (PACE EH).  I provided training in Alabama and Tennessee, as well as for the Indian Health Service. \r\n\r\nI served as Project Director for the, “Southeast Region Environmental Public Health Academic Center” from October, 2004 – September, 2007. For that project which involved provision of technical assistance, consultation, and training, I had the responsibility for day-to-day implementation of all facets of the project, particularly in those areas involving establishing and maintaining operations relating to the project’s partnerships with the environmental public health leadership in 10 southeastern states and two U.S. territories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRESUME of Thomas C. Struzick\t\t\t\t\t\tPage Three\r\n\r\nI presently serve (since October, 2007) as the Training Facilitator and Project Evaluator for a CDC-funded, three-year, $325,000, capacity building project.  This project addresses formation of collaborative partnerships to implement a best-practice, community-based mosquito control project.   I wrote the grant application \r\nfor this project for the Jefferson County Department of Health. \r\n\r\n\tMy work with these research projects has broadened my vision on issues which need to be addressed in the design, implementation, management, and \r\nevaluation of health promotion and disease/injury prevention programs, with a particular emphasis on communication between providers and consumers of public health services.\r\n\r\n\tIn March, 2000, I was appointed to the position of Associate Director of the Center for Community Health Resource Development.  In that position, I am responsible for providing administrative and management support to the Center Director and the Center staff.  In 2009, I was appointed as the Director of Training for the UAB Prevention Research Center.  \r\n\r\nI have served on several university-wide committees addressing research and training for cultural competence; health literacy; obesity and diabetes; religion and spirituality in health research work group; and the integrated medicine (CAM) partnership. \r\n\r\nI am a diversity training specialist with the UAB Human Resources Organizational Development Office.  As such, I serve on the instructional design team and an instructor with the DIVERSITY UAB programs.  I have taught the Basic Concepts class and the Diversity Awareness Education 2-hour employee orientation class.  I am certified by the Franklin Covey program to teach, “Championing Diversity”.  I am also working with several UAB departments/schools on developing training resources to cultural competence. I have provided training for graduate and undergraduate students in dentistry, health care professions, and public health. \r\n\r\nI also have a faculty appointment as a Research Assistant Professor for our university’s bachelor social work education program in the School of Social and Behavioral Science.  I have taught social work practice courses since 1993.  Those courses include generalist social work practice with an emphasis on the strengths-based perspective and field seminar; social work ethics and values; HIV and Social Work; Cultural Diversity and Social Work Practice; Social Work in Health Care Settings; and Social Welfare Policy Analysis.  I also served our BSW program as the Field Instruction Coordinator for two and a half years.  \t \r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMUNITY SERVICE\r\n\r\n\tI have served on several boards of directors and have done volunteer work for many different health and human service agencies. Presently, I am a founding member of the board of directors for Times Out, Inc., a 501 (c) (3) organization providing companionship services for persons with severe and chronic physical and \r\nRESUME of Thomas C. Struzick \t\t\t\t\t\tPage Four\r\n\r\nmental illnesses. I am a founding member of the Jefferson County Children’s Policy \r\nCouncil and serve at the chairperson for the Health Committee. I also serve on the Children’s Hospital’s Advisory Committee for the Comprehensive Health Education Center for Kids (C.H.E.C.K.).  I serve as a volunteer social work advisor for Birmingham AIDS Outreach supervising social workers and conducting training for agency staff. \r\n\r\n\r\nPROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS\r\n\r\n\tI am a member of the National Association of Social Workers and the Academy of Certified Social Workers.  For public health and environmental health, I am a member of the National Environmental Health Association. \r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLICATIONS\r\n\r\nOn Environmental Health: \r\n\r\nReport:\r\n\r\n1.

He has a Master’s Degree in Psychology from Sonoma State University and is a member of the United Association of Labor Educators (UALE).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome related examples of work:\r\n\r\nThe National Bison Range Complex.\r\n\r\nThis complex negotiation began in 2007.  I first assessed the project and then designed and facilitated the process of negotiation.  The project resulted in a signed agreement in September of 2008.  As the lead trainer and lead facilitator, I helped the parties identify where their respective interests were similar, where they were different (yet not conflicting) and where there were potentially conflicting interests.  I helped the parties develop strategies and processes for maximizing similar and different interests while minimizing and/or overcoming potentially conflicting interests.  As lead facilitator, I also helped the parties develop meaningful procedural ground rules and substantive proposals for mutual gain.  I also helped the parties develop and implement dispute resolution processes, and establish on-going review stages to insure continuous improvement and agreement monitoring.  \r\n\r\nAfter five months of facilitated meetings and substantive negotiations, Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of the Flathead Reservation and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service signed an historic annual funding agreement (AFA) for the National Bison Range Complex.  The Complex is located in Moiese, Montana, within the boundaries of the Flathead Indian Reservation.  On June 19, 2008, the Tribes and the Fish and Wildlife Service signed a three-year funding agreement, representing a government-to-government partnership to share management responsibilities for the National Bison Range.   Outcome: After a 90-day Congressional review period by the Senate Indian Affairs Committee and the House of Representative’s Natural Resources Committee, the Annual Funding Agreement became final on September 24, 2008.  \r\n\r\nThe Timberline Lodge Compact.  The Timberline Lodge Compact (TLC) is a Public/Private Partnership between RLK, Inc. and the USFS.  TLC is a thirty-year (30) agreement developed through a series of facilitated meetings in November and December of 2007.  The Compact Agreement expresses the parties’ intentions and serves as the working document for this innovative, long-term and viable public/private partnership.  \r\n\r\nAs the trainer and facilitator, I helped the parties identify where their respective interests were similar, where they were different (yet not conflicting) and where they held potentially conflicting interests.  I then helped the parties develop strategies and processes for maximizing similar and different interests while minimizing and/or overcoming potentially conflicting interests. I also helped the parties develop meaningful procedural ground rules; processes to deal with conflicts throughout the life of the agreement; and processes to update and improve their agreements with on-going review at certain stages.  The agreement covers, but is not limited to: organization and staffing; financial resources and needs; revenues, fees and appropriations; gratuities and surcharges; and funding.   Outcome:   Private-Public Agreement-February 2008.\r\n\r\n\r\nDefense Dept./Tribal Governments Project: Government-to-Government Consultation: 2006 – current.  I serve as a trainer and as a facilitator for these training and problem solving projects.  I designed the intercultural communication portion and IBN portion of this multi-faceted project. I am the facilitator between DoD personnel and Tribal participants.  The program is designed to increase DoD and Tribal awareness of each other and of their cultures.  The best government-to-government consultation practices are explored and current problems or questions that parties are experiencing are discussed and problem-solved. Locations have included Anchorage, Seattle, Tulsa, Elmendorf Air Force Base, Silverdale, Washington, and Fairbanks.  Parties have included Air Force, Coast Guard, Army, Navy personnel, numerous federal and state government participants and a variety of tribal governments and personnel.   Outcomes:  Training Completion and/or Facilitated Agreements.\r\n\r\nUSEPA, Navajo EPA and Navajo Grassroots Groups:  Served as principle trainer and facilitator for EPA-OEJ project that worked with the Navajo Government, Navajo EPA and four Navajo grassroots groups: Dine Care, Black Mesa Water Coalition, C’Aquifer for Dine, and the Indigenous Waters Network.  Outcome:  This 8 month project led to the creation of a preliminary agreement on the Protocols on Communication and Collaboration between the Navajo Environmental Justice Grassroots Organizations and the Navajo Nation EPA on January 30th, 2007.\r\n\r\n\r\nOregon DEQ/Use Attainability Analysis: \r\nI served as co-facilitator on this complex case involving the EPA, Oregon DEQ and tribal, federal, private business, citizen groups and other state agencies regarding the Clean Water Act. Purpose: To create a document intended to describe the information Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (ODEQ) staff should review to determine (1) whether a designated use change is appropriate, (2) what use is attainable in the water body and (3) that appropriate criteria are established to support the new designated use. The developed document guides the ODEQ in applying existing statutes and rules related to a Use Attainability Analysis.  Parties included, but were not limited to the following.  NGO: River Network, American Rivers, Columbia River Intertribal Fish Commission; Federal agencies: NOAA, BPA, USFWS, USBR, Army Corp of Engineers, USFS; State agencies: ODA, Oregon Dept. of Forestry, Oregon DEQ; and Tribes: Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde, Confederated Tribes of Siletz, Warm Springs. The first workgroup meeting occurred on June 30, 2004.  Five additional meetings were scheduled for August through November of 2004.  A final draft of the guidance document was made available in November 2004.    Outcome:  State Guide developed and operational in 2005.   \r\n\r\nPortland General Electric/Hydropower Re-licensing:  \r\nI served as primary trainer and secondary facilitator in this yearlong project involving the re-licensing of the Willamette Falls Hydroelectric Project.  The issues were scientific, environmental, political, financial and legal.  Environmental issues ranged from water quality and water quantity, the impact of the Endangered Species Act, the Clean Water Act, the Oregon Water Quality Act, and more.  Participants included Portland General Electric, Blue Heron Paper Company, the National Marine Fisheries Service, US Fish and Wildlife Service, Oregon Department of Water Resources, the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality, Oregon Fish and Wildlife, The Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation of Oregon, The Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians, The Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon, American Rivers, The Native Fish Society, Oregon Trout, and others.  Outcome: Hydropower re-license obtained.\r\n\r\nPortland General Electric/Hydropower Negotiation Training and Facilitation:  \r\nProvided a series of negotiation training and facilitation for Portland General Electric, the US Forest Service, Oregon State DEQ, FERC, the Oregon HART group, Oregon Tribes and others on hydropower related issues and re-licensing concerns related to the Willamette and Clackamas Rivers. Outcome: All parties trained.\r\n\r\nDept. of Interior and Southern Plains Tribes Project:\r\nProvided a series of facilitated discussions on the development of various models and processes that would allow tribes to address their own leadership disputes without resorting to tribal or federal courts.  The models and processes ultimately developed would not replace any existing tribal laws and tribes would not be required to use them.  Rather, models and processes would be an option available for a tribe having difficulty communicating effectively, or wanting to deal internally with leadership disputes.  The processes and models were collaboratively developed by tribal leaders, federal and state officials, law enforcement agencies, and tribal or CFR court representatives, and had an emphasis on process flexibility and cultural relevancy. Parties included the Caddo, Kaw, Iowa Tribe of Oklahoma, Citizen-Pottawatomie, Comanche, Sac & Fox Nation of Oklahoma, DOI, BIA -CFR Court, and the Southern Plains Regional Office and Washington D.C. offices of the BIA.  Outcome:  Model developed.\r\n\r\nPort of Portland and Citizens Noise Advisory Committee: November 1999 to January 2001.  I provided a series of IBN training and subsequent facilitation services for the Port of Portland and the Citizens Noise Advisory Committee (CNAC) regarding noise pollution and airline flight routing.   The focus was on parties working together collaboratively to finding solutions. CNAC representatives included the City of Vancouver, Washington, the City of Portland, Oregon Multnomah County, Oregon, Clark County, Washington, and neighborhood spokespersons, the Port of Portland and several environmental groups. Outcome:  Agreement reached.\r\n\r\n Oregon State Department of Forestry: June 2001 to November 2001: \r\nI provided IBN training and facilitated a series of meetings for the Oregon State Department of Forestry in Astoria and Forest Grove, Oregon.  Parties included representatives from the State of Oregon, counties, cities, tribes, private citizens, environmental groups and privately owned timber and forest products companies.  The goal was to provide a focus group forum where representatives with diverse viewpoints can discuss implementation plans and advise Oregon Department of Forestry districts on plan alignment with the NW Oregon State Forests Management Plan. Both groups provided a written report and a series of jointly -developed recommendations to respective District Foresters and the Department of Forestry as end products.  Outcome: Jointly developed District Reports and Recommendations.\r\n\r\nState of Oregon and the 9 Oregon Tribes: Served as the principle facilitator on the development and implementation of government-to-government negotiations between the State of Oregon and 8 of the 9 Oregon Tribes. The process involved preparing the representatives of the Oregon tribes to sit down with the negotiation team representing all state agencies to create a framework and protocols for developing and managing government-to-government consultations.\r\nOutcome:  A two-day meeting between the nine Tribes and the State of Oregon was facilitated at which time a new consultation and negotiation framework was developed to ensure improved relationships and government-to-government protocols.  Oregon was the first state to initiate this type of process.\r\n\r\n\r\n	2015-02-27 05:24:48.735948	2015-02-27 05:24:48.735948	306

As project engineer, Mr. Streaker is part of the Biohabitats team that conducted stream geomorphic surveys on the approximately 4,000 linear feet restoration project for the Baltimore City Department of Public Works, Bureau of Water and Wastewater.  The survey consisted of collecting stream cross section, profile, planform geometry, and characterization of the streambed of the existing incised channel.  This will support the natural channel design techniques utilized in the design plans to stabilize the degraded stream channel.  The project goals are to improve water quality by reducing the introduction of sediment into the stream system by stabilizing actively eroding banks and improving aquatic and riparian habitat. \r\nPoplar Spring Court Stream Restoration, Fairfax County, VA.

Ms. Von Grossmann organized and led a series of workshop/charrette meetings involving the UNC-Charlotte Chancellor’s office and community stakeholders, to determine if any alternative alignments will be carried in the EIS to serve the University campus directly in addition to surrounding development. A key stakeholder was the Carolinas Medical Center - University, adjacent to the campus. Despite being vocal from the beginning of the process about differences, participants created 10 alignment alternatives, evaluated them to reduce to a short-list of three, then selected a preferred alternative with a total consensus.\r\nNew York, NY, Lower Manhattan-Jamaica-JFK Airport Transportation Alternatives Study; 2005. Ms. Von Grossmann worked with a team developing schematic station design and siting alternatives for four options that would improve transit connections between Lower Manhattan, Jamaica and JFK Airport. Options included extensions of service for the Long Island Railroad, New York Metro and the AirTrain in various combinations for both underground and elevated stations. In addition to technical station design, his work focused on internal and external pedestrian circulation at each station location as well as head house placement on the surface and incorporated within existing buildings.\r\nWith other affiliations:\r\nLos Angeles County Transportation Commission (LACTC), Hollywood/Vine Metro Red Line Station Master Plan Assessment, Los Angeles, CA; 1992. Responsibilities included schematic design and programming for joint development and multimodal transfer. The placement of a subway station in this historic theatre district required land use analysis and a master plan which promoted existing and new, symbiotic uses.\r\nLong Island Rail Road, Seven Stations Project, Long Island, NY; 2000. Conceptual design studies for three stations led to Ms. Von Grossmann’s role as Design Architect for Bethpage Station, through completion of final design. This modest commuter rail station included ticketing, waiting and two retail spaces for passenger services, and full accessibility. Key design features included vaulted ceiling in the waiting room, and eyebrow dormers over the connection to the platform.\r\nPark City Municipal Corporation, Park City Transportation Plan/Intermodal Centers, Park City, UT; 1999. Ms. Von Grossmann was involved in a transportation master plan and transportation facility design as a part of Park City’s preparation for the 2002 Olympics. Products included schematic design of intermodal centers on two distinct sites; alternative analysis and site selection; an Environmental Assessment; and, coordination with client, community interests, and local, regional, State, and Federal agencies.

Also conducted public outreach, including presentation and facilitation at community workshops and presentation graphics.\r\nMerrimack Valley Regional Transit Authority (MVRTA), Commuter Rail Station Improvements: Lawrence, Andover and Ballardvale Stations, MA; 2000. Ms. Von Grossmann led the programming and design processes in this project to improve the integration of these stations into their communities and to meet increased parking demand. It resulted in the relocation of the Lawrence commuter rail station to a site that would better reinforce the pattern of renewal in Lawrence’s historic mill district. Lawrence Station’s program is mixed- use, including structured parking, transit-supportive development, and improved intermodal connections. The improvements requested through public process at the Andover and 132 \r\nBallardvale Stations were limited to minor parking expansion, design of the pedestrian environment and intermodal connections. The Ballardvale site has the added complexity of being located in a historic residential district.\r\nPioneer Valley Transit Authority (PVTA), Springfield Union Station Redevelopment, Springfield, MA; 1999. Ms. Von Grossmann developed and documented a Station Area Master Plan which staged development according to demand and civic investment in the district; conceptual design alternatives for the historic Union Station building and surrounding streetscape; a signage and lighting program and guidelines; a Master Plan Update document; and use, massing and development alternatives for the adjacent Charles Hotel development parcel within the historic district. These products were used in the organization of a developer solicitation and Request for Proposal program.\r\nMassachusetts Highway Department (MassHighway), Central Artery/Tunnel Project, Boston, MA; 1995. Ms. Von Grossmann served for several years as Urban Design Lead in the downtown Boston area for this $14 billion interstate highway project. Responsibilities involved policy development, master planning and design, interdisciplinary coordination, and ongoing community and agency participation for a 27-acre development district including:\r\n• urban designer for the Pedestrian Issues Forum; • master planning and analysis of future air-rights joint development above an interstate highway\r\ntunnel;\r\n• preliminary (25%) design of the surface street system focusing on accommodation for pedestrians, bicycles, vehicular traffic, and future development; and,\r\n• review of final design documents and coordination with final designers.\r\nAlso developed a master plan and joint development analysis in the South Boston district.

The D. L. Mud Superfund site in Vermilion Parish was a mud mixing facility that was listed as a Superfund site in October 1989.  Under emergency removal actions, the majority of the waste was disposed of off site.  The ROD included off site disposal of organic hot spots, restricted access to prevent contact with slightly elevated heavy metals in the surface soils,  and reopener clauses if the groundwater contamination increased in severity.?                                          ?     Wilma Subra was the Technical Assistant under the TAG program to the Coalition for Community Action an environmental justice community in Alsen, Louisiana for the Petro Processors Superfund site from July 1992 to September 1994.  The Petro Processors site was a commercial hazardous waste disposal facility which received waste from the petrochemical facilities along the Mississippi River.  The initial remedy involved the construction of an on-site lined disposal vault, excavation of the waste and  disposal of the waste in the vault.  During the waste excavation activities, air emissions caused workers at adjacent plants and community members to become ill.  The remedy was stopped and the second remedy involved covering the site (two separate waste disposal areas) with clay caps.  Under the second remedy, the waste is being extracted through sumps and recovery wells and is being treated on site through incineration. After the initial three year TAG grant period, the Coalition for Community Action decided not the renew the grant due to difficulties within the community group in administering the business aspects of the grant.  Since the end of the TAG contract period, technical assistance has continued to be provided to the Coalition for Community Action on a pro bono basis by Ms. Subra.??     In 1995, Wilma Subra began serving as one of the Technical Advisors to Slidell Working Against Major Pollution (SWAMP) for the Bayou Bonfouca Superfund site in Slidell, Louisiana.  The Bayou Bonfouca site was an old creosote treating facility.  The remedy selected by EPA was incineration of the waste, sludge and bayou sediments.  The incineration of the Bayou Bonfouca waste has been completed and the incinerator residue landfilled on the Superfund site.  Ground water remediation is  in progress utilizing the pump and treat method. ??     In May 1995, Wilma Subra began serving as the Technical Advisor for Slidell Working Against Major Pollution (SWAMP) on the Southern Shipbuilding Superfund site, in Slidell, Louisiana.   The?Southern Shipbuilding site was an abandoned ship building operation with extensive contamination of the ground, ground water,  and surface water resources in the area and down stream of the facility.  The remedy was excavation of the waste, incineration at the Bayou Bonfouca incinerator, and  disposal of the waste in an on site cell. The remainder of the site was cleaned up to residential  standards and developed as a residential subdivision.  ??     In 1995, Uncertain Audubon hired Wilma Subra as their Technical Advisor for the Longhorn Army Ammunition Superfund site in Karnack, Texas.  The Ammunition military site was utilized to produce a large variety of army arsenals and to dispose of explosives, ammunition and Persian Missiles.  The facility has in  excess of fifty individual sites that were investigated for the presence of hazardous waste.  Old landfill areas on the site have contaminated groundwater with free phase solvents.  Waste from one old waste disposal area has migrated into Harrison Bayou which flows into Caddo Lake.  Caddo Lake serves as the drinking water source for Shreveport, Louisiana.  Industrial facilities on the site have  been identified as sources of surface water contamination by perchlorate.  This is an emerging military contaminant issue receiving extensive investigation at the national level.  The Longhorn Army Ammunition Superfund site has utilized the Restoration Advisory Board (RAB) process, the Community Advisory Group (CAG) process and the Technical Assistance Grant?(TAG) processes to evaluate the issues and proposed remedial actions at the site.  The property on the Ammunition site and the remedial activities associated with reuse designations has been designated for wildlife management preserves,  reuse as commercial property and recreational areas.  Evaluation of these reuse options drove the remedial activities at the site.  ??     In 2001, Citizens Against Toxic Exposure (CATE) selected Wilma Subra as the Technical Advisor for the Escambia Treating Company (ETC) Superfund site in Pensacola, Florida.  The ETC site is an abandoned wood treating facility in an environmental justice community.  Under the Superfund process the ETC site has had the relocation of two sets of environmental justice communities.  The waste from the wood treating facility has contaminated the groundwater off site for four miles from the site.  The waste from the site has been excavated, solidified and replaced in cells on the site.  The site is now being developed for reuse as commercial  and small business facilities.  ??     In 2000, Southwest Workers Union requested technical assistance from Wilma Subra for the Kelly Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas.  Kelly was undergoing Base Realignment  (BRAC) and the reuse of the facility was a controversial topic with the  environmental justice community of hispanics living in the area surrounding Kelly.  Kelly was the oldest air force base continuously operating in the United State.  A large number of organics, solvents, heavy metals and radioactive contaminants had  contaminated surface and subsurface soils, surface water bodies and aquatic organisms, and groundwater with free phase materials. The shallow groundwater off site was contaminated with organic solvents for four miles off site under the residential area of San Antonio.  The shallow groundwater contaminants off gas into the homes over the contaminated groundwater plume.  The Kelly site has as RAB.  The hispanic community is for the most part excluded or silenced by the RAB and have to depend on additional technical assistance from  Ms. Subra to deal with the impacts of the Kelly facility on their health and environment.  Meanwhile Kelly now known as Kelly USA is operating with military contractors performing similar activities as was conducted when the base was Kelly Air Force base.  The operations of Kelly USA are having extensive negative impacts on the hispanic communities along with the historical negative impacts of the previous operations. ?                                             ?     In 1993 and 1994, Wilma Subra served as a Technical Advisor to the National Commission on Superfund.  The commission consisted of broad based representation of the various stakeholders in the Superfund process (industry, federal agencies, state agencies, local government, insurance companies, national environmental organizations, grass roots environmental groups, Native American tribes, and environmental justice representatives).  Wilma Subra serves as the Technical Advisor to the minority grass roots representative on the Commission and served on many key policy committees.  The commission was formed to make recommendations for the reauthorization of the Superfund legislation based on their broad based experience of working within the Superfund process since its inception.??     In 2002 and 2003, Wilma Subra served on the EPA National Advisory Council for Environmental Policy and Technology (NACEPT), Superfund Subcommittee.  The Superfund Subcommittee consisted of a broad spectrum of governmental officials, regulatory agencies, industries involved in the Superfund process and environmental, environmental justice  and non-governmental representatives.  Wilma Subra served as the NACEPT official representative to the Superfund Subcommittee.  The Subcommittee was formed to oversee the Superfund process and make recommendations for the immediate and long term future of Superfund.  The recommendations were presented to the NACEPT Council and forwarded to the Administrator of EPA. \r\n	2015-02-27 05:24:50.259975	2015-02-27 05:24:50.259975	319

He was responsible for evaluating risks and health hazards\r\nassociated with vapor entering homes from contaminated groundwater into nearby homes. He was responsible for\r\nevaluating current toxicological peer-reviewed toxicological studies on formaldehyde to identify current health problems\r\namong residents, determine acceptable levels of exposure, and identify homes that may require interim measures or\r\nevacuation of residents.\r\nDr. DeGrandchamp conducted a background analysis implementing Procedural Guidance for Statistically Analyzing\r\nEnvironmental Background Data, which he authored for the Navy, at NAS Whiting (Milton Florida). This approach is\r\nbeing used to identify chemicals of concern for risk assessment, evaluate Applicable or Relevant and Appropriate\r\nRequirements (ARAR), and identify chemical releases. Successful completion of this project is expected to save DOD\r\nDr. Richard L. DeGrandchamp\r\nPage 7 of 10\r\nSCIENTIA VERITAS, L.L.P.\r\nand the state of Florida $30 million in potential remediation costs.\r\nDr. DeGrandchamp has conducted a comprehensive review and analysis of diverse scientific methods used to evaluate\r\nrisks associated with lead exposure for DON. He prepared a Navy position paper that evaluated all lead risk assessment\r\nmodels, including the scientific veracity of the U.S. EPA Integrated Exposure Uptake Biokinetic Model (IEUBK)\r\nsoftware code, the California Lead Spread Model, and the new probabilistic Integrated Stochastic Model to make\r\nrecommendations for improvement. He is also developing the DON risk assessment strategy to evaluate adult lead\r\nexposure in order to expedite lead cleanup at closing Naval installations.\r\nDr. DeGrandchamp has developed a cost-effective, risk-based corrective action approach for a hazardous waste site for\r\nLockheed Martin in Denver, Colorado. The approach incorporated Monte Carlo simulation techniques to accurately\r\nestimate actual site-specific risks based on realistic exposures. A cost-benefit matrix was being developed to guide risk\r\nmanagement decisions.\r\nDr. DeGrandchamp provided technical expertise on wide-ranging issues to EPA Regions 8 and 6 RCRA and CERCLA\r\nprograms. He provided toxicological and statistical support on all remedial investigations and feasibility studies\r\nconducted at Rocky Flats Nuclear Weapons Plant (RFP) and was involved in all investigations pertaining to the analysis\r\nof human health risks resulting from chemical and radionuclide exposures. He developed data quality objectives and risk\r\nassessment methodology, statistical analysis, sampling and analysis plans, and oversaw all chemical and radiological fate\r\nand transport modeling. He compiled a database for conducting Monte Carlo simulations and provided technical review\r\non supplemental guidance for conducting Monte Carlo simulations for EPA Region 8. He developed a cost-effective risk\r\nassessment template for RFP to streamline and provide consistency for all risk assessments. Dr. DeGrandchamp was\r\nresponsible for evaluating DOE’s statistical analyses and risk assessments, and ensured results were consistent with U.S.\r\nEPA, the International Commission on Radiation Protection (ICRP), and Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC)\r\nmethodologies. He assisted EPA Region 8 in negotiating numerous disputes and was a participant in a workgroup of\r\nnationally recognized experts in binding arbitration involving statistical analyses. He was selected as a member of an\r\ninteragency committee that included the Colorado Department of Natural Resources, Colorado Department of Health,\r\nColorado Fish and Wildlife Service, EPA Region 8, and DOE to scope, design, and implement a comprehensive\r\ninstallation-wide human health and ecological risk assessment for Rocky Flats.\r\nDr. DeGrandchamp provided scientific expertise to DOE on toxicological, risk assessment, and statistical issues at the\r\nSavannah River Site (SRS) in South Carolina. He reviewed human health risk and dose assessments conducted for\r\nnumerous operable units and participated on a task force responsible for establishing background conditions. He was\r\ninvited to lecture on risk assessment and statistical issues by EPA Region 4, DOE, and the South Carolina Department of\r\nHealth project managers and toxicologists.\r\nDr. DeGrandchamp conducted numerous baseline risk assessments at Naval Air Station (NAS) Lemoore in California.\r\nThese risk assessments were ultimately combined into a comprehensive installation-wide risk assessment that involved\r\nfate and transport modeling of contaminants, coupled with the analysis of current and potential future health risks. He\r\nwas responsible for all negotiations with federal and state regulators. He successfully negotiated cost-effective\r\nmanagement of human health risks during remedy selection by using a risk-based approach to avoid unnecessary and\r\nexpensive remediation\r\nDr. DeGrandchamp conducted all risk assessments and coordinated feasibility studies for NAS Moffett Field in\r\nCalifornia. He carried out a detailed future land use analysis that was used to focus risk mitigation strategies based on\r\nprobable future land use. The land use analysis was also used to focus human health risk assessments on realistic\r\nexposure conditions to avoid unrealistic conservative default assumptions. He negotiated all aspects of the risk\r\nassessment approach with state and federal regulatory agencies. The Navy requested Dr. DeGrandchamp to assist the\r\nDr. Richard L. DeGrandchamp\r\nPage 8 of 10\r\nSCIENTIA VERITAS, L.L.P.\r\nDepartment of Justice to avert formal dispute resolution.\r\nDr. DeGrandchamp conducted risk assessments for NAS Alameda in California. He was responsible for developing the\r\noverall risk assessment approach and negotiating all technical aspects of the Navy project with local, state, and federal\r\nregulators. He was also tasked with preparing innovative approaches to establish anthropogenic and nonanthropogenic\r\nbackground conditions, preliminary remediation goals, and data aggregation to estimate exposure-point chemical doses.\r\nHe was also responsible for developing a Navy policy document for risk-based corrective action (RBCA) at petroleum\r\nsites.\r\nDr. DeGrandchamp provided oversight to DOD for risk assessments conducted for NAS China Lake. He was responsible\r\nfor implementing a risk-based, cost-effective approach for remediation and alternative cleanup levels based on actual site\r\nexposures.\r\nDr. DeGrandchamp provided technical expertise to the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection for\r\nradionuclide risk assessments, compliance, and cleanup standards. He worked with the state to develop state guidance for\r\nradionuclide cleanup of all Department of Defense and Nuclear Regulatory Commission operated sites within the state.\r\nDr. DeGrandchamp provided EPA Region 8 with technical oversight for all remedial investigations and risk assessments\r\nfor F.E. Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming and Tooele Army Depot in Utah. He conducted a risk assessment in\r\nresponse to an emergency exposure condition for off-site residents at F.E. Warren AFB who were directly exposed to high\r\nconcentrations of organic solvents.\r\nDr. DeGrandchamp led the human health and environmental risk assessment task force for EPA Region 6 in studying\r\npotential adverse health effects associated with emissions from several incinerators in Midlothian, Texas. This\r\ninvestigation was prompted by strong public concern about adverse health effects on humans and livestock. In this\r\nevaluation, Dr. DeGrandchamp analyzed the potential for dioxin to produce birth defects, spontaneous abortions, and\r\nother potential toxic effects.\r\nDr. DeGrandchamp investigated the human health risks associated with RCRA facilities in southern California. He\r\nconducted the risk assessment for the onsite human receptors, as well as the surrounding community, to determine the\r\npotential risks to pregnant woman from benzene, arsenic, and cadmium exposure in groundwater. He also evaluated the\r\nrisks to fetuses via in utero exposure. At another RCRA facility, he conducted a risk analysis to determine potential risks\r\nassociated with arsenic-laden fly ash used as landfill material.\r\nDr. DeGrandchamp provided oversight and technical support to the EPA Region 8 (Montana office) RCRA division for\r\nremediation of oil refineries in Billings, Montana; Mandan, North Dakota; and Commerce City, Colorado. He oversaw all\r\nphases of the RCRA process involving preliminary investigations and corrective measures studies. His developed healthprotective\r\ncleanup levels, and evaluated facility permitting and remediation enforcement. Together with Colorado\r\nDepartment of Health officials, he worked to negotiate remediation goals and a cost settlement.\r\nBIOMEDICAL RESEARCH\r\nDr. DeGrandchamp investigated the neurotoxic mechanisms associated with exposure to mercury and acrylamide. This\r\ninformation was incorporated into the toxicological database developed by U.S. EPA and the Occupational Safety and\r\nHealth Administration to set regulations and establish safe exposure conditions for occupational workers.\r\nDr. DeGrandchamp investigated the neurotoxic effects of alcohol on the developing nervous system, which produces fetal\r\nDr. Richard L. DeGrandchamp\r\nPage 9 of 10\r\nSCIENTIA VERITAS, L.L.P.\r\nalcohol syndrome. He was responsible for developing new research methodologies and approaches to investigate subtle\r\nmolecular changes in the nervous system.\r\nDr. DeGrandchamp designed experimental paradigms to study the bioavailability of mineralogical forms of heavy metals,\r\nsuch as arsenic and cadmium, from mining tailings for a CERCLA site in Montana.\r\nDr. DeGrandchamp worked on a project for the National Institutes of Health to investigate the neurophysiological\r\nmechanisms of strychnine poisoning. In this capacity, he coordinated a team of experts and managed all technical\r\npersonnel in a multifaceted research program to elucidate the steps that result in central nervous system damage.\r\nDr. DeGrandchamp further refined the neurotoxic esterase in vivo enzyme assay used to evaluate neurotoxic damage\r\nresulting from nerve agents and pesticides. This laboratory method has become a standard methodology to screen\r\nneurotoxic compounds in the chemical industry and to evaluate the neurotoxic potential of chemical weapons. He also\r\ndeveloped a correlative animal model for U.S. EPA to quantify chemical-induced neuropathies associated with exposure\r\nto pesticides and nerve agents.\r\nPUBLICATIONS AND POLICY DOCUMENTS\r\nDr. DeGrandchamp has authored over 100 major toxicological and human health risk assessments that have undergone\r\nextensive peer-review. However, many of these reports could not be published due to confidentiality or proprietary\r\ninformation.\r\n1. DeGrandchamp, Richard L. 2007. Expert Report of Dr. Richard L.

1073	Marion		Cox				Sante Fe		\N	\N	20810	225	Owner and manager	Re source Associates	25	MARION COX\r\n\r\nEDUCATION\r\n\r\n1971\t\tB.A., Foreign Language and Political Science, Auburn University\r\n1973\t\tM.U.A., Urban Affairs, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University\r\n1982\t\tPost Graduate Studies:  Negotiation, Mediation, Environmental Conflict \t\t\t\tManagement, Harvard Law School, Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  \r\n1985\t\t"How to Mediate Scientific and Technical Disputes", Massachusetts Institute of \t\t\tTechnology \r\n\r\nEMPLOYMENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nMs. Cox currently owns and manages an environmental services company with offices in Bethesda, MD and Santa Fe, NM.  Ms. Cox’s practice focuses on public involvement, collaborative planning and problem-solving, mediation/negotiation, and meeting facilitation services for clients involved in environmental management programs and initiatives.  Ms. Cox has previously worked for State and Federal government agencies as well as for the private sector providing environmental consulting services.  These positions include: \r\n\r\nServing as a Vice President with ICF Incorporated and ICF Kaiser Engineers for seven years.\r\n\r\nServing as Deputy Regional Manager with the Federal Office of Coastal Zone Management, NOAA, U.S. Department of Commerce, where she worked with state Executive offices, state legislatures, special interest groups, Indian tribes, and the public in developing state coastal management programs. \r\nServing as Planning Analyst for the State of Wisconsin's Office of Planning and Energy and staff to the Wisconsin State Coastal Management Council.\r\n\r\nEXPERIENCE\r\nThe following projects are representative of the work Ms. Cox has accomplished and are organized according to major areas of emphasis:\r\n\r\nENVIRONMENTAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION and NEGOTIATION\r\n\r\n· Serving as the senior convenor/facilitator for the Hudson County [NJ] Brownfields Pilot Project [sponsored by local governments and US EPA].  The key parties in this project include local residents in the affected communities, local development and planning agencies, state economic development offices, and the US EPA.  One of the key challenges in this project is to identify and address the wide variety of interests and concerns about the re-development and re-use of the Brownfields areas targeted in this pilot project.  Another challenge is to fully integrate the needs and views of the local communities into development decisions where they are typically not at the table.\r\n\r\n· Serving as senior convener and facilitator for US EPA’s Drinking Water Initiative exploring with key stakeholders and the general public possible changes to the “public notification” requirements with drinking water violations.  Since inception, the EPA has needed to ensure that public notification results in quick and clear action by the facilities out of compliance and decisive action by the public in responding to any potential health risks.  This project brought these parties together with EPA to determine how best to address these important public heath and environmental compliance needs.\r\n\r\n· Serving as meeting planner and facilitator to organize and facilitate a nationwide meeting on Asbestos regulations for US EPA’s Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics [OPPT].  In this project, the facilitator had two key tasks: 1) plan for and facilitate a meeting among EPA headquarters and regional staff regarding contentious internal agency issues; 2) during the same 4-day national meeting, plan for and facilitate a meeting involving all states and regional offices to discuss proposed changes to EPA Asbestos regulations.  The Agency did not have a positive history of interaction with these parties, and had not held a national meeting for 5 years previous to this meeting.  There were over 120 people in attendance.  The key challenges were to plan a meeting that met many different expectations; to design interactions so that negative feelings held by many participants would not be highlighted or dominate the meeting; and to involve 120 participants in a meaningful dialogue about key regulatory issues.\r\n\r\n· Serving as senior facilitator and meeting planner for three US EPA NACEPT Subcommittees charged with developing controversial environmental policies.  This project involved working with EPA to design the agendas and meeting process for nationally appointed advisory committees to discuss and debate key policy issues facing US EPA.  In addition, Ms. Cox served as the lead facilitator at these NACEPT meetings working to ensure the active participation of all members, ensuring that the goals of the committee were actively pursued, and assisting the members in reaching consensus on key issues as appropriate.\r\n\r\n· Serving as senior convenor/mediator to work with a local community, organized interest groups, State and Federal regulatory agencies, and the responsible party at a hazardous waste landfill where historical tensions and animosity among the parties was creating political and legal challenges.  Ms. Cox initially conducted a convening process and defined a basic process for communication and consultation that allowed the parties to begin talking productively about how they wanted to work together in the host of activities associated with site investigation and remediation of the landfill.  Ms. Cox conducted a conflict assessment interviewing representatives of all key parties, identifying the key issues and working with all the parties to design a public involvement process that would address these issues.  Ms. Cox’s work resulted in an approved public involvement process which all parties agreed to work together to implement.  Ms. Cox currently serves as a neutral advisor to all the parties as they implement the approved process, and to address emerging issues. \r\n\r\n· Serving as senior facilitator in a dispute between US EPA, and an Hispanic community regarding the adequacy of the proposed remedial decision at this site.  Ms. Cox’s  activities included interviewing parties regarding proposed actions at this site; identifying local information needs; planning and facilitating public meetings between the community and the responsible party.  Ms. Cox performed this work under a Community Technical Assistance Grant and represented the community in all aspects of her work at this site.\r\n· \r\n· Assisting Mecklenburg County, North Carolina to develop recommendations related to surface water management.  This project required the convenor/facilitator to plan for and facilitate a series of meetings for an Advisory Committee made up of diverse parties in the County to discuss and reach consensus on managing the county’s surface waters.  The key parties had very diverse needs and there was a general feeling of distrust among participants.  The careful design and structure of these meetings allowed participants to communicate in a new and better way.  The meetings were carefully and professionally facilitated to ensure that all participants were given equal opportunity to present their points of view.  The group did reach consensus recommendations on water quality management, and presented these recommendations to the County Commission.\r\n\r\n· Serving as the senior convenor and facilitator for a roundtable entitled “Future Directions for Environmental Compliance” sponsored and hosted by US EPA New England.  The leading private sector companies throughout New England met with senior level managers from US EPA HQ and Region 1.  This project involved working with participants from EPA and the regulated community to develop a concept for this meeting where all participants could be candid and creative in their discussions about environmental compliance.  The regulated community and US EPA were able to identify a host of “original” ideas which EPA New England will pursue as part of its overall initiatives in environmental compliance throughout the region.\r\n\r\n· Mediating disputes between EPA and local communities concerning  proposed Superfund actions.  Ms. Cox managed ICF's Conflict Management Services practice [$3.8 million annually].  Ms. Cox mediates site specific disputes related to the Superfund program.  Key actors in these community-based disputes are interviewed and a conflict assessment is prepared.  Based upon an analysis of the effectiveness of using mediation/facilitation, she will move forward to try to convene the parties in conflict and mediate a settlement. \r\n\r\n· Designing a negotiated permitting project for a resource recovery facility subject to Rhode Island state and local permit requirements.\r\n\r\n· Designing and facilitating a meeting of academic, scientific, and technical experts from around the country to discuss the key issues associated with the use of a "risk-based" approach to the development of RCRA Landfill Disposal regulations.\r\n· \r\n	2015-02-27 05:24:50.620452	2015-02-27 05:24:50.620452	327

Our particular focus is reductive dehalogenation of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) by anaerobic bacteria.\r\n\r\nOur lab’s research interests are in molecular environmental microbiology, environmental biotechnology, and molecular microbial ecology/evolution.\r\n\r\nMore specifically: (1) Identification, characterization, and isolation of bacteria that catalyze reductive dechlorination of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in anaerobic sediment. (2) Identifying the enzymes involved in PCB dehalogenation and the genes that encode them. (3) Understanding how these dehalogenating enzymes evolved. (4) Development of effective processes to activate PCB dechlorination in situ. \r\n\r\nWe are working with microbial cultures that remove specific chlorines from at least 64 different PCB molecules with different chlorine substitution patterns. The bacterial population that does this belongs to a recently discovered and highly unusual group of bacteria known as Dehalococcoides. These use halogenated compounds such as chlorinated ethenes, chlorinated benzenes, and PCBs as terminal electron acceptors. In fact, halorespiration, replacing halogens with hydrogen atoms, is their only known means of growth. Genomic studies have shown that all strains of Dehalococcoides have multiple nonidentical reductive dehalogenase genes, and some have as many as 32 putative reductive dehalogenase genes. One of our objectives is to identify and characterize the reductive dehalogenases that dechlorinate PCBs and to understand how widespread they are, how they are regulated, and how they evolved. We are collaborating with several laboratories at other Universities in this effort.\r\n\r\nSelected Publications\r\n\r\nD. L. Bedard, K. M. Ritalahti, and F.E. Löffler.  2007.

Her research at K-State focuses on understanding the chemistry of both nutrient and contaminant elements in soils, with the goal of developing solutions to agricultural or environmental problems. For example one of her current projects, goal is to find ways to remediate underutilized, mildly contaminated soils (often call “brownfields”) into soils suitable for productive use, such as community gardens. Another project focuses on understanding reaction products of fertilizers in soils to find ways to increase the fertilizer use efficiency.\r\n\r\n* Conduct interdisciplinary research to understand the biogeochemistry of both nutrient and contaminant elements in the natural environment\r\n* Apply knowledge of soil and environmental chemistry to develop solutions to environmental problems\r\n\r\n\r\nPublications:\r\n\r\n* Biasioli, M., J.

Her specific research interests involve the fate and transport of persistent organic pollutants (POPs), especially polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs); pesticides; and petroleum.\r\n\r\nDr. Lee and her research group use enantioselective chromatography to understand the transformations and transport of chiral contaminants through soil, sediments, water, and biota. Chiral contaminants have stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images, which often react at different rates while undergoing biological transformation. The difference in transformation rates provides insight about the fate of contaminants in natural systems.\r\n\r\nPublications:\r\n\r\nDang, V. D.; Walters, D. M.; and Lee, C.

Johnson. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUtilities and Private Sector Public Participation\r\n\r\nBeginning in the late 1970s, Creighton also began working with the private sector on public involvement issues including the siting of a crude oil pipeline (Northern Tier Pipeline Company), siting of a coal gasification plant (Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Company), and siting of numerous transmission lines (Pacific Gas & Electric, BC Hydro, Puget Power & Light, Public Service of Colorado, PSI Energy, Hawaii Electric, Florida Power & Light, Transmission Agency of California, Central Power & Light, Southern California Edison, Western Area Power Administration). Other industry clients include the Salt River Project, (establishing a citizen task force to review company policies and rate structures), Pennsylvania Power & Light (working with an advisory group to develop alternative futures scenarios to test corporate strategy), and Arizona Public Service (assisting an advisory group to get organized, establish groundrules, and select its leadership).  \r\n\r\nCreighton is the author of the Edison Electric Institute’s Public Participation Manual (Second Edition, 1994). Creighton also designed and conducted public involvement training courses for the Edison Electric Institute throughout the U.S. He has conducted public involvement training programs for the American Public Power Association, and clients in Canada including BC Hydro and Ontario Hydro. He is a frequent speaker at utility industry conferences. \r\n\r\nFor the Hewlett Packard Corporation, Creighton designed and facilitated a process for working with residential neighbors regarding siting of a major new office building (now world headquarters for Agilent Technologies). He also conducted training for McCaw Cellular on siting of cellular antennas, and has facilitated meetings between neighbors and developers for several residential developments. \r\n\r\nDispute Resolution\r\n\r\nFrom 1988-1998, Dr. Creighton headed a team of nationally recognized experts in dispute resolution that provided assistance to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in the use of alternative dispute resolution techniques (ADR) as an alternative to litigation. The Corps ADR program won the Hammer Award from the Secretary of Defense. As Principal Investigator of this program, Creighton oversaw a team of the nation's leading ADR consulting firms who are developing training courses, editing a series of techniques pamphlets, editing a quarterly ADR newsletter, and providing direct consultation as part of the Corps program. Creighton has been directly involved in developing a series of pamphlets providing an overview of ADR, and covering specific techniques such as mini-trials and non-binding arbitration, as well as editing several case studies and a reader of articles on ADR and public participation.\r\n\r\nCreighton also designed and led a team which conducted a series of dispute resolution training courses in Russia and the Republic of Georgia.  The program was sponsored by The International Foreign Policy Association, with funds from the U.S. Agency for International Development.\r\n\r\nOther projects completed by Creighton include:\r\n\r\n•\tWriting a guide on “partnering” which has been distributed to all Department of Defense entities\r\n\r\n•\tConducting an assessment of “less successful” partnering cases\r\n\r\n•\tDeveloping a case study on the use of mediation to resolve EEO complaints\r\n\r\n•\tDeveloping a partnering guide for the Directorate of Civil Works, and conducting briefings on partnering nation-wide\r\n\r\n•\tDeveloping and facilitating an interest-based negotiation process used by the Bonneville Power Administration to renegotiate all of its power sales contracts with Bonneville's 150 utility customers.  (BPA supplies much of the power to the four states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana).\r\n\r\nCreighton has served as a mediator on a number of local issues.  Examples include mediating a dispute between the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts and the Regional Water Quality Control Board over contaminant standards; mediating a dispute between Ventura County Health Department and the Ventura Regional Sanitation District over solid waste planning; mediating a dispute about a long-standing commercial operation in a residential neighborhood (Menlo Park, CA); and assisting a citizen task force in Menlo Park. CA, in developing consensus recommendations regarding limits on additions to existing homes.  He coordinated negotiations between the Northern Tier Pipeline Company and seventeen Washington counties regarding mitigation and social effects of that project, and initiated a similar process on the WyCoalGas project.\r\n  \r\nCreighton prepared the script for a videotape titled Conflict Resolution: A Primer for Communities, developed by Pennsylvania Power & Light, in cooperation with the League of Women Voters, and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources.  He also led a team, under the sponsorship of the Edison Electric Institute, which developed and conducted a consensus-building course combining public participation and mediation/negotiation techniques for utility managers, and has also conducted conflict management training for the American Electronics Association.   He also developed and conducted a conflict management training program for the Bonneville Power Administration.\r\n\r\nNew Ways of Working/Distributed Work\r\n\r\nJames L. Creighton is Co-Director of the New Ways of Working Network. (www.NewWOW.net). The Network is a membership organization that brings together thought leaders from companies implementing cutting-edge programs of distributed work, remote work, and workplace design. Creighton and his partner create symposia, conduct roundtables, and oversee research related to these topics. Recent studies they’ve overseen include such topics as cultural impact on work practices, work practices for distributed work groups, remote work and productivity, virtual team space, and the role of “place” in a distributed world. Creighton has personally prepared reports on the history of the office and best practices in remote virtual teams. His most recent publications include:  Work 2020: The Effect of Higher Oil Prices on the Future of Work and What Every Senior Executive Needs to Know about Distributed Work, which summarizes the findings of the Network over the past three years. The Network’s membership has included such organizations as Applied Materials, Cisco, Haworth, Johnson Controls, Jones Lang LaSalle, Knoll, Microsoft, Nokia, SMART Technologies, Inc., Stanford University, Unilever, U.S. General Services Administration, and VTT (Finnish national laboratory).\r\n\r\nCreighton is the author (with James W.R. Adams) of CyberMeeting: How to Link People and Technology in Your Organization (AMACOM, 1988) which predicted how trends in technology, facilities, and group process would come together to enhance collaboration and team productivity. \r\n\r\nCreighton has been a speaker on distributed work and collaborative technology issues at conferences or training programs sponsored by the American Management Association, International Facility Management Association, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Workplace Productivity Consortium, InView (videoconference presentation), Telecon Brazil, and at workshops for Finnish entrepreneurs sponsored by TEKES, the Finnish national technology agency. Creighton also conducted training at the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil, for staff of the School of the Future who subsequently set up more than 150 internet-access centers (telecentros) in Brazil’s poorest neighborhoods.\r\nCreighton was a consultant to SPANWorks, a start-up company in San Ramon, CA, developing meeting productivity software for a wireless meeting room network that ties together participants’ laptops, digital whiteboards, and digital projectors. \r\n\r\nCreighton has conducted training at the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil, for staff of the School of the Future who have set up more than 150 internet-access centers (telecentros) in Brazil’s poorest neighborhoods.\r\n\r\nCreighton’s interest in team productivity dates back to the 1970s when he developed a Team Action Workbook and training course for the Willamette National Forest and conducted training courses on managing interdisciplinary teams for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Over the years he has conducted more than 25 team building sessions, often with multi-organization teams.\r\n\r\nPartnering/Team Collaboration\r\n\r\nIn recent years Creighton has also prepared guides and training program on “partnering,” a technique for improving the effectiveness of inter-organizational project teams, for the Department of Defense and Corps of Engineers. Creighton has also developed training courses for multi-agency planning and management of natural resources on military installations. \r\n\r\nSome of his recent projects include:\r\no\tConducting studies on “collaborative planning “ – planning studies that are jointly managed by several federal agencies with different and sometimes conflicting missions – including case studies, an analysis of institutional barriers to cooperative planning, and development of a cooperative planning web site.\r\no\tDeveloping a “joint stewardship” training course for federal agencies with shared natural resource management responsibilities on Department of Defense training facilities\r\no\tDeveloping a training course for federal and state agencies involved in jointly developing natural resource plans for Department of Defense installations\r\no\tDeveloping guides on “partnering” for the Department of Defense Environmental Mission and the Corps of Engineers Civil Works Mission.\r\n\r\nMeeting/Conference Design and Facilitation\r\n\r\nCreighton has designed and facilitated literally hundreds of public meetings, work groups, and conferences for more than twenty-five years, including work on the White House Conference for Global Change. Creighton has been involved in facilitating public meetings for such controversial issues as Orme Dam (on President Carter's "hit list" of western water projects), whether to restart construction of the WPPSS 1 & 3 nuclear power program, the cleanup program for Kesterson Reservoir, and more than fifty other projects. Creighton was also a facilitator for the National Energy Consensus Experiment, an effort to get agreement on a national energy policy between 50+ national leaders of all the major interests concerned with national energy issues. He also facilitated a national series of meeting for the Corps of Engineers, designed to identify strategic issues in water management.  \r\n\r\nHe has designed and conducted conflict-resolution conferences bringing scientists and technical experts from around the world to establish research priorities regarding storage of nuclear waste in crystalline rock (Lawrence Berkeley Laboratories), fisheries (smoltification) on the Columbia River (Bonneville Power Administration), and social impacts of coal development in the West (Bureau of Land Management).  Other conferences were designed to get agreement on research protocols for assessing cumulative impacts of energy development upon wildlife (U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service) and developing criteria for emission of toxics in bays and streams (U.S. Bureau of Reclamation), and resolve water issues in the Sacramento River Delta.  Creighton was also retained by the U.S. Committee on Irrigation and Drainage to design and facilitate a workshop bringing together key people in agriculture with environmental leaders to hammer out a proactive program for agriculture's handling of hazardous or toxic substances.  Creighton also prepared a pamphlet summarizing the group's recommendations, which has been distributed nationally within agriculture.\r\n\r\nRisk Communication\r\n\r\nDr. Creighton has worked extensively with utilities on siting of controversial facilities, and this led him into the risk communication field.  He is the principal author of two manuals for the Tennessee Valley Public Power Association, Understanding Electric and Magnetic Fields (EMF) and Communicating with the Public About Electric and Magnetic Fields (EMF). Also for the Tennessee Valley Public Power Association, and with the assistance of Robert S. Banks Associates, Creighton prepared a risk communication manual and video tapes and designed and led a training program that won a trophy award from the American Society of Association Executives.\r\n\r\nCreighton also completed a study for Pennsylvania Power & Light in which he reviewed risk communication practices of major U.S. utilities related to the EMF issue. Creighton is also the author (with Robert S. Banks) of a manual on risk communication titled Sourcebook for Utility Communications on EMF that is published by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI)\r\n\r\nCreighton has made two presentations on public participation and risk communication to National Academy of Science - National Research Council panels providing review of the Army’s program for disposal of chemical weapons.\r\n\r\nCreighton recently played a major role in developing a community partnering plan for siting of Pennsylvania’s Low-Level Radioactive Waste disposal facility. This plan outlined the process by which the state and its contractors would work with local communities to find a volunteer community willing to act as host of the facility. \r\n\r\nHe was also an instructor for the EPRI Risk Communication Workshop, which is offered periodically to member utilities.  In addition to working on this issue as part of the many transmission line projects on which he's been involved, Dr. Creighton assisted the Florida Electric Power Coordinating Group in preparing testimony on EMF which was presented to the Governor's Scientific Advisory Panel.  He also assisted Public Service of Colorado in making a presentation to the Douglas County Commissioners regarding EMF.  He has also consulted on this issue to the Tennessee Valley Authority, PSI Energy, and others.  \r\n\r\nCreighton co-developed and co-instructed the Edison Electric Institute's EMF Risk Communication Training Course.  He also co-authored a guide for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency which addressed public involvement and risk communication issues related to siting of solid waste facilities. He is a frequent speaker and workshop leader in the risk communication field.  Recent speaking engagements on risk communication include the California Manufacturer's Association, Santa Clara Valley Manufacturer's Association, Canadian Electrical Association, Colorado Power Council, Edison Electric Institute, Electric Power Research Institute, Florida Municipal Electric Association, Western Systems Coordinating Council, Alberta Power Planning Council, and Northwest Public Power Association.\r\n\r\nAlternative Futures Planning/Strategic Planning  \r\n\r\nIn the mid-1970s Dr. Creighton became concerned that many organizations were so committed to a straight-line projection of the future that they were both unresponsive to public concerns, and in danger of being non-responsive to changing circumstances. As a result he began to devise planning processes which involved the public in identifying alternative futures scenarios and protected an organization's ability to respond to these alternatives.  His first project, for the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, was an analysis of the future water needs of four California counties.  The techniques developed during this study were published by the Bureau in a guide titled Alternative Futures Planning.  Since that time he has applied alternative futures planning techniques in a variety of situations including land use planning (Klamath County, Oregon), long-range corporate planning (Wickes Corporation), land management (U.S.  Forest Service and U.S. Bureau of Land Management), projecting the future service load of a utility  (Pennsylvania Power & Light), developing long-term goals for a construction agency (Corps of Engineers), and assessing major issues facing public power in the United States (American Public Power Association).  Working with researchers from the U.S. Forest Service, he co-developed a simulation game designed to teach forest managers to plan flexibility for a variety of changing external conditions.  Dr. Creighton also prepared a "strategic directions" guide for the Office of Strategic Initiatives, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  Creighton also assisted with the design of the North Dakota 2000 and Eugene Decisions strategic planning processes.\r\n\r\nSocial Assessment/Institutional Analysis\r\n\r\nCreighton was a member of a team of social scientists that developed a social assessment guide for the U.S. Bureau of Land Management during the early 1980s. This team included many of the leading figures in the field, and Dr. Creighton served as facilitator of the group meetings.  Subsequently he co-authored the guide itself, which was later issued as a text titled Guide to Social Assessment: A Framework for Assessing Social Change (Westview Press: 1984).  He also developed a social impact assessment-training program for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  He also conducted an extensive review of the value literature for the Corps of Engineers, with a particular emphasis on its usability in public involvement and social assessment.  More recently he prepared a report on the socioeconomic impacts of terminating irrigation on 49,000 acres in California's San Joaquin Valley, and studies on the future of agriculture in the San Joaquin Valley (U.S. Bureau of Reclamation).  He also analyzed the institutional barriers to water conservation and the establishment of a trust fund to purchase water savings (U.S. Bureau of Reclamation).  He was also a member of a large team assessing the potential socioeconomic effects of locating a high-level nuclear waste repository at Hanford, Washington.  Creighton headed the Monitoring & Mitigation Group, which prepared a draft Monitoring & Mitigation Plan for the state before Nevada was chosen as the repository site.\r\n\r\nDr. Creighton headed a team conducting an assessment of the social impacts on major changes to Federal water law and practices involved the Central Valley project in California. He also wrote a Technical Appendix for a major EIS describing institutional alternatives for decision making regarding future operation of the Columbia River System, and was a member of the team identifying social impacts associated with possible changes in river operations.  \r\n\r\nCreighton recently completed a draft guide on assets-based community development for the Idaho Department of Health & Welfare.\r\n\r\nOrganizational Development  \r\n\r\nDr. Creighton's consulting practice began in the organizational development field.  Prior to establishing his own consulting practice, he worked closely with Dr. Thomas E. Gordon, and under his guidance developed the first participant's workbook for Leader Effectiveness Training, which later became a nationally-recognized training program.  After establishing his own practice, he conducted training courses on communication skills, meeting leadership, and participative management for a number of clients including corporations such as Hewlett Packard, Wells Fargo Bank, Travenol Laboratories and Control Data, a number of school districts, and governmental agencies such as the U.S. Forest Service and U.S. Department of Labor.  He trained counselors for the Neighborhood Youth Corps, Job Corps, Alameda County Probation Department, and the Berkeley Public Schools, and trained Economic Opportunity Program and Economic Assistance Office counselors for the University of California, Davis.  He also developed a counselor's guide for the U.S. Department of Labor.  Dr. Creighton worked with training staff at the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation to develop an extensive program to train internal facilitators to conduct team-building sessions throughout the Bureau.  He has conducted numerous team-building sessions himself, for a variety of governmental and private sector clients.  He also prepared a Team Action Workbook for the Willamette National Forest, which is a self-administering workbook that a supervisor can utilize to develop more effective team decision making.  In recent years he has not concentrated on the organizational development field, but has conducted team building sessions with interdisciplinary and interagency teams as part of many of the other projects on which he has worked.  \r\n\r\nStress Management  \r\n\r\nDuring his early work at Bridge Mountain Foundation, Dr. Creighton was trained in the use of a number of relaxation and stress management techniques, and continued to utilize these techniques personally, even when his professional interests moved in new directions.  In 1976 both he and his wife, Maggie Creighton became interested in the work of Dr. O. Carl Simonton and Stephanie Matthews-Simonton, who were exploring the role which psychological factors played in both the onset and recovery from cancer.  For several years both the Creightons served as consultants to the Simonton's Cancer Counseling & Research Center in Fort Worth, Texas, developing the Center's professional training programs.  During this period Dr. Creighton co-authored Getting Well Again with the Simontons.  This book has sold more than a million copies and has been translated into seventeen languages.  \r\n\r\nSubsequently Mrs. Creighton founded the Cancer Support and Education Center in Menlo Park, CA. James Creighton took a leave of absence from his consulting business for 18 months to set up and manage all business operations of the Center. He served as a member of the Board of Directors of the Center for nearly 10 years. For a number of years he also conducted communications training for cancer and HIV-AIDS patients.\r\n\r\nDr. Creighton also developed a Managing Corporate Stress training program which he has conducted for such clients as the Wickes Corporation, Grass Valley Group, University of California Extension (Davis), Yuba County Probation Department, U.S. Army Executive Development Program, U.S. Forest Service, and others. \r\n\r\nGeneral Information  \r\n\r\nAcademic:  Dr. Creighton received his B.A. in Psychology from the University of California, Berkeley, where he also participated in departmental honors programs in American Studies and Political Theory. He received his Ph.D. in Psychology from the International Institute for Advanced Studies, Clayton, Missouri (external degree). A revised version of Creighton’s doctoral thesis was published as Don’t Go Away Mad: How to Make Peace with Your Partner (Doubleday, 1991). Creighton’s books, The Public Participation Handbook, and Involving Citizens in Community Decision Making have been assigned reading for classes at John F. Kennedy School of Government, Portland State University, University of Illinois, University of Colorado, Rutgers, George Mason University, University of Virginia, and other U>S> and international universities. Creighton has given guest lectures at Princeton University, Stanford University, University of Vienna, University of Sao Paulo, and the University of California, Santa Cruz and Davis.  He has also taught several courses for the University of California Extension. Creighton serves on the Editorial Board of Water Policy. \r\n  \r\nPre-Consulting Experience: Prior to becoming a consultant Creighton served as Executive Director of Bridge Mountain Foundation, developing and conducting an adult education program designed to enhance creativity and encourage personal growth.  He also served as Regional Coordinator of Dr. Thomas E. Gordon's Parent Effectiveness Training, training and supervising approximately seventy part-time instructors conducting training programs for parents and teachers in communication and mutual problem-solving skills. He also had experience in the electronics industry in management training, wage and salary administration, corporate communications, and professional recruiting.  \r\n\r\nRosters: National Roster of Environmental Dispute Resolution and Consensus Building Professionals, US Institute for Environmental Conflict Resolution, Tucson, AZ.\r\n\r\nMemberships: International Association for Public Participation (Founding President and 5-term Board member); International Association of Facilitators; International Association for Impact Assessment; The Authors Guild.\r\n\r\n \r\nPUBLICATIONS  \r\n\r\nBOOKS  \r\n\r\nThe Public Participation Handbook, Jossey-Bass Publishing, 261 pgs, 2005\r\n\r\nHow Loving Couples Fight: 12 Essential Tools for Working Through the Hurt, Aslan Publishing, 281 pgs., 1998.\r\n\r\n(with James W.R.

In one project, Clausen and Cherie L. Geiger developed catalytic active emulsion systems that are capable of removing and destroying PCBs from painted surfaces. PCB stands for Polychlorinated biphenyls. They are a cocktail of chemicals, first created in the 1920's, that were used in the manufacturing process of numerous items: from electronics to paints. In the 1970's, PCBs were linked to environmental and medical problems-including cancer in humans-and were consequently discontinued. Today, PCBs are illegal to produce, but many older products (such as rocket launch platforms and navy ships) contain PCBs and are still in use. Using nano-sized iron and magnesium particles in a special process, Clausen and Geiger found a way to safely breakdown the PCBs in materials without harming any of the surrounding structures.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these catalytic active emulsion systems, Clausen and his colleagues have also synthesized new environmentally-safe materials for use as screening aerosols against smart weapons in the infrared and millimeter wavelength regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. They developed a catalytic reactive emulsion system capable of in situ dehalogenation of chlorinated hydrocarbons in contaminated soils and sediments. They created new nanometer-sized catalyst systems that can be used with current green chemistry industrial chemical processes, and have developed of new, high-efficient catalytic systems that reduce air pollutants emitted by stationary power sources that use hydrocarbons and coal energy sources.\r\n\r\nMost notably, Clausen's laboratory had outlined many new processes, such as a methodology for using Mössbauer Spectroscopy to measure the elctronegativity of functional groups in inorganic coordination complexes, a process for using hydrogen peroxide to reduce volatile organic compounds and NOx emissions, and a process for using ultrasound to regenerate the activity of permeable reactive barriers.\r\n\r\nSelected Publications:\r\n1.

Specifically, I am proposing to develop training materials and deliver training to tribal\r\ncommunities on collaborative problem-solving (CPS) and appropriate dispute resolution\r\n(ADR).\r\nMy company, Intrinsic Consulting LLC, is a Native American- and woman-owned public\r\ninvolvement company with offices in Flagstaff, Arizona, and Wimberley, Texas. Intrinsic\r\nspecializes in community infrastructure, environmental and transportation projects. Services\r\ninclude facilitation, process design, public involvement/participation, issue advocacy,\r\ncommunity relations and public education, public meeting organization, issue mapping and\r\nstrategic planning. Intrinsic’s mission is to generate and act on ideas that offer intrinsic value\r\nto our customer organizations, capitalizing on our collective skills and experience.\r\nI have ample experience working with tribes and tribal communities on issues of\r\nenvironmental and public health concerns utilizing skills in problem-solving and dispute\r\nresolution. Specific projects have addressed and incorporated environmental justice\r\nprinciples, and I have facilitated a variety of processes to resolve environmental and public\r\nhealth disputes involving tribes and tribal communities. I have also developed and delivered\r\na number of trainings and presentations nationwide on working with tribes and tribal\r\ncommunities.\r\nThank you for this opportunity. I look forward to working with Skeo Solutions and the EPA’s\r\nOffice of Environmental Justice to design and provide this training.\r\nSincerely,\r\nDexter Albert, Owner/Manager\r\nIntrinsic Consulting, LLC\r\nDexter Albert Qualifications\r\nTribal Training Consultant\r\nJune 3, 2011\r\nQualifications\r\nIntrinsic Consulting, LLC, is a Native American- and woman-owned public involvement firm and is\r\ncertified as a Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) in the state of Arizona. Intrinsic’s mission is to\r\ngenerate and act on ideas that offer intrinsic value to customer organizations, capitalizing on our\r\ncollective skills and experience. Intrinsic has extensive experience working with tribes and tribal\r\ncommunities on numerous public involvement, stakeholder facilitation, citizen outreach and conflict\r\nresolution projects.\r\nIntrinsic has developed and delivered local and nationwide presentations and trainings on topics such as\r\nopportunities to connect with tribal communities, communication processes and decision-making in\r\ntribal communities, relationship-building with tribal nations, mediation processes and tribal culture, and\r\ncultural sensitivity. Intrinsic is adept at coordinating with tribal agencies at all levels of tribal\r\ngovernments to involve them in planning processes, and has assisted in the development of\r\npartnerships and agreements between tribes and public agencies. Through extensive research and work\r\nwith dozens of tribes, Intrinsic has identified and implemented best practices on communication and\r\ncollaboration with tribes and tribal communities. Some examples include employing multi-faceted\r\ncommunication methods when working with tribes; allowing flexibility in the project schedule to\r\naccommodate internal tribal practices and typically already overwhelming workloads; acknowledging\r\nthat tribes are socially, culturally and politically diverse and cannot be perceived as homogenous; and\r\nrecognizing that tribes tend to approach problem-solving and decision-making more holistically than the\r\ndominant society and government agencies.\r\nSome examples of Intrinsic’s work with tribes include:\r\n?? A nationwide study regarding collaborative efforts between transportation agencies and tribal\r\ncommunities for the National Transportation Research Board in 2009-2010;\r\n?? A statewide survey of tribal transportation officials in Arizona as part of a Rural Transit Needs\r\nStudy for the Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT) in 2006-2007;\r\n?? Facilitating meetings in Phoenix, Dallas and Chicago for a national workgroup comprised of\r\nrepresentatives from tribes and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to develop and\r\nimplement a national underground storage tank compliance strategy for the EPA in 2004-2005;\r\n?? An EPA-funded Community Master Plan for the Gila River Indian Community in 2009;\r\nDexter Albert Qualifications\r\nSkeo Solutions/EPA – Tribal Training Consultant\r\nPage 2\r\n?? Tribal involvement and government-to-government consultation during the development of a\r\nnational planning rule for the Southwestern Region of the US Forest Service in 2010;\r\n?? Roadway safety improvements on Route 6 for the San Carlos Apache Tribe in 2010-2011;\r\n?? And an ongoing project to conduct regional workshops with tribes nationwide regarding\r\nrevisions to land use regulations for the Bureau of Indian Affairs.\r\nAdditionally, Intrinsic has worked with government agencies to provide tribal relations, public\r\ninvolvement/outreach and partnership building on numerous transportation projects throughout Indian\r\nCountry during the past six years, including feasibility studies, environmental studies, Design Concept\r\nReports, final design projects, scenic byways planning, educational campaigns, and roadway\r\nconstruction outreach.\r\nDexter Albert, owner and manager of Intrinsic, is an experienced facilitator, community organizer,\r\noutreach specialist and event planner. He has worked on many rural and tribal relations projects in\r\nnorthern Arizona, the Southwest and throughout the country. Both clients and the public have\r\nconfirmed Dexter’s superior organizational skills, as well as responsiveness and sensitivity in dealing\r\nwith public concerns. Dexter is an enrolled tribal member who grew up on a tribal reservation, giving\r\nhim a unique perspective and direct exposure to the work Intrinsic does. He has a living knowledge of\r\nlocal American Indian cultures and is respected for his ability to be inclusive and to reach out across\r\ntribal affiliations. Dexter brings with him expertise in working with multiple tribes and facilitating\r\ndifferent ideas so that a diverse group can come to consensus around a topic or concept. Ultimately, he\r\naims to work with stakeholders and project teams to achieve mutual understanding and outcomes that\r\nare beneficial to all participants.\r\nDexter’s experience includes\r\n?? Co-facilitating a listening session with tribes regarding the development of mutual trust,\r\neffective communication and cooperation to improve government-to-government relations and\r\naddress common natural and cultural resource issues in the Southwest for the Bureau of Land\r\nManagement in 2006;\r\n?? Developing a comprehensive Tribal Involvement Plan as part of a forest plan revision project for\r\nthe Coconino and Kaibab National Forests in 2006-2007;\r\n??

And facilitating dialogue between agency decision-makers and tribal leaders at a Bald Eagle\r\nTribal Consultation Meeting for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 2008.\r\nDexter holds a certificate from the International Association for Public Participation (IAP2) for public\r\nparticipation training. He is also a member of the U.S. Institute for Environmental Conflict Resolution’s\r\n(USIECR) National Roster of Environmental Dispute Resolution and Consensus Building Professionals, the\r\nDexter Albert Qualifications\r\nSkeo Solutions/EPA – Tribal Training Consultant\r\nPage 3\r\nUSIECR Native Dispute Resolution Network, the Environmental and Public Policy Section of the\r\nAssociation for Conflict Resolution, the Coconino County Inter-Tribal Advisory Council, the Grand Canyon\r\nChapter of IAP2, and the New Mexico Mediators Association.\r\nRelated Experience\r\nDexter has worked on numerous projects related to the upcoming training. The following case studies\r\noffer insight into his prior experience and qualifications related to the current effort.\r\nPROJECT WORK\r\nGila River Indian Community (GRIC) CARE Program: The purpose of the project was to create a\r\ncommunity partnership within GRIC to identify and prioritize environmental toxics, with the ultimate\r\ngoal of developing a community risk reduction plan. EPA Region IX retained Dexter Albert of Intrinsic as\r\na third party neutral to coach the GRIC CARE team and help prepare them for the community\r\ninvolvement process. By coaching, mentoring, training and demonstrating various skills, including\r\nfacilitation, strategic planning, outreach, visioning and mapping exercises, Dexter was able to provide a\r\nboost to the overall CARE process. In addition, Dexter worked to develop structure and instill leadership\r\nin internal team meetings and helped to create a strategic plan and timeline. At the conclusion of\r\nDexter’s role in the project, he prepared a detailed report of his activities including lessons learned and\r\nrecommendations for further activity.\r\nUnderground Storage Tank Strategy – Tribal Facilitation: In August 2005, the U.S. EPA was given one\r\nyear to develop and present to Congress a nationwide strategy, in coordination with Indian tribes, to\r\ngive priority to Underground Storage Tanks (UST) that present the greatest threat to human health or\r\nthe environment. The EPA Office of UST developed a workgroup consisting of both EPA staff and Native\r\nAmerican representatives. The EPA wanted to develop a clear understanding of what a national strategy\r\nfor USTs on tribal lands should include based on the views of both EPA and tribal workgroup members.\r\nDexter’s role was to garner participation from at least 50 tribes (out of more than 500 tribes\r\nnationwide), as well as EPA headquarters and staff from 12 different regions under extreme deadline\r\npressure. He had to ensure that one particular region or tribe did not dominate the discussion, and the\r\nworkgroup had less than one year to complete the strategy and present its findings. Dexter helped\r\nfacilitate a series of meetings between EPA officials and tribal representatives to develop and implement\r\nthe national UST compliance strategy, including meetings in Phoenix, AZ; Dallas, TX; and Chicago, IL. He\r\nassisted participants in articulating their interests, identifying areas of agreement, and recommending\r\nsolutions. He also helped to keep the parties talking, listening, and moving toward the goal of the\r\nprocess. The national workgroup worked on a draft of the strategy, and the final strategy was submitted\r\nto Congress on time.\r\nDexter Albert Qualifications\r\nSkeo Solutions/EPA – Tribal Training Consultant\r\nPage 4\r\nSonoran Bald Eagle Tribal Consultation: In 2007, the US Fish & Wildlife Service (USFWS) arranged a\r\nmulti-tribal consultation meeting with Arizona tribes regarding the petitioned and court ordered\r\ndetermination on whether or not to recognize the Sonoran bald eagle as a distinct population and\r\nwhether or not protection under the Endangered Species Act was warranted. A number of tribes were\r\nconcerned that the USFWS could only accept scientific and commercial information as part of its\r\ndetermination. While purely cultural/religious information falls outside of what can be considered, tribal\r\ntraditional information regarding biology, status or threats to bald eagles may be considered. Dexter\r\nAlbert of Intrinsic Consulting was retained as a third-party facilitator to ensure that all tribes had an\r\nopportunity to fully participate in the consultation meeting. Dexter assisted the USFWS in developing\r\nthe meeting agenda design and format and methods for eliciting and recording feedback. He facilitated\r\nthe meeting in a manner that encouraged the sharing of information, recognized speakers in an orderly\r\nand respectful manner, assessed expectations of all parties and strived to meet those expectations\r\nwithin the limits of the meeting and comment-period time frames. Following the meeting, Dexter\r\nprovided a review of the proceedings and made recommendations for improving the multi-tribal\r\nconsultation format for future consideration by the USFWS.\r\nHomestake Mining Superfund Site Facilitation: Dexter Albert of Intrinsic was retained by EPA Region VI\r\nto co-facilitate a community meeting in Grants, New Mexico, together with Lucy Moore. The issues\r\nfacing the agencies and community were extremely complex, including a lack of safe drinking water;\r\nincreasing contamination of groundwater migrating toward municipal supplies; compromise of the\r\nimpermeable cover on the tailings pile; possible airborne contaminants; possible health conditions\r\n(cancers, birth defects) related to the Superfund site; plummeting property values and the inability to\r\nsell contaminated parcels; unclear negotiated agreements with the responsible party; and multiple\r\nsources of contamination not included in the Superfund site, but impacting residents. There existed a\r\nlong history of abuse as perceived by the community, which had often been frustrated by the reluctance\r\nof the agencies to communicate with the community and answer questions. The lay public also was\r\nunable to understand the high degree of difficult technical information related to the site. The meeting\r\nhighlighted for the agencies the importance of providing clean drinking water for the residents as soon\r\nas possible, and helped bring the resources to focus on the issue. Anecdotal evidence and evaluations\r\nshowed that community members were pleased with the degree of communication that occurred. They\r\nwere especially pleased with the way the meeting was facilitated successfully, and meeting evaluation\r\nforms suggested a high degree of satisfaction with the facilitators (average rating of 4.2 out of a scale of\r\n5). At the conclusion of the project, Dexter and Lucy prepared a report summarizing the comments\r\nheard at the meeting and providing recommendations for future steps.\r\nTRAININGS\r\nWorking with Native Communities: A Practical Guide to Better Communication: Dexter Albert has\r\noffered various iterations of this training throughout the United States during the past six years for the\r\nInternational Association of Public Participation, the Southwest Community Impact Assessment, and the\r\nUS Environmental Protection Agency, as well as annually for the past three years for Coconino County,\r\nDexter Albert Qualifications\r\nSkeo Solutions/EPA – Tribal Training Consultant\r\nPage 5\r\nArizona. Each presentation has been tailored to the area in which it was given. The presentation focuses\r\non practical advice and tips for working in and communicating with tribal communities, as well as\r\ngeneral cultural sensitivity guidance based on field experience, research and personal knowledge. The\r\nobjective is to help attendees better understand cultural differences between Native Americans and\r\nnon-Native Americans and is most beneficial for those relatively new to working with tribes in general.\r\nHowever, this interactive session is eye-opening even to the more experienced.\r\nGila River Indian Community Master Planning: Cultural Sensitivity Training: Dexter co-presented this\r\ntraining for consultants and staff members working with the Gila River Indian Community to develop\r\nMaster Plans for each of seven districts. In addition to providing practical advice and tips for working\r\nwith the Gila River Indian Community, the presentation offered specific details about the community’s\r\nhistory, structure and operations. The objective is to prepare consultants and their staff members to\r\nwork successfully with the Gila River Indian Community as they developed the Master Plans. Dexter copresented\r\nthis training with an Intrinsic partner, who is a member of Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian\r\nCommunity as well as the Menomonee and Oneida nations of Wisconsin.\r\nTribal Mediation and Negotiation Processes: Dexter co-presented this training at the 2007 Association\r\nfor Conflict Resolution conference in Phoenix, Arizona. This presentation explores how tribes approach\r\nconflict resolution differently from other ethnic groups by focusing on the areas of Navajo social\r\nconstruct, customary governance, peacemaking and traditional problem solving. The objective is to offer\r\nparticipants insight into traditional processes, how those processes can support collaborative decisionmaking\r\nand how dispute resolution methods are driven by the cultures of the negotiating parties.\r\nThird-Party Roles in Deliberative Democracy and Consensus Building in Native American Communities:\r\nDexter co-presented this training at the 2007 Environmental and Public Policy Conflict Resolution\r\nConference in Jupiter, Florida. This presentation focuses on the decision-making process and presents a\r\ncomparison/contrast between consensus and deliberative democracy in Native American communities.\r\nThe objective is to identify how our work leading collaborative efforts and building consensus help\r\npromote deliberative democracy. We discuss Navajo Chapter Houses as the epicenter of decision\r\nmaking in Navajo Country and offer comparisons of the Chapter House meeting to the Vermont-style\r\ntown hall meeting. We describe how Chapters are the democratic focal point of Navajo communities\r\nand how the Chapter has become institutionalized in the Navajo political arena.\r\nRate Structure\r\nDexter’s rate is $115/hour for all services rendered.\r\nResume Attached\r\nDEXTER ALBERT BIOGRAPHY & RESUME\r\n928-522-6015 ? dexter@intrinsicinfo.com ?

In that capacity, he was responsible for the operation of two dozen facilities designed for the removal of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from groundwater supplies located throughout the State of New Jersey.  Both Granular Activated Carbon (GAC) and packed-tower aeration were employed to remove VOCs to comply with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection’s stringent VOC standards.  In New Jersey, the Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) for Trichloroethylene (TCE) is 1 part per billion (ppb) as compared to the Federal MCL of 5 ppb.  As such, the VOC removal facilities were operated to yield maximum removal efficiency.\r\nThe selection of GAC or air-stripping technology was based upon a number of factors including the concentration of VOCs in the raw water, site dimensions, access constraints, and permitting requirements.\r\nAdditionally, he has conducted research supporting water utility operations for more than nine years. His research and operational experience has led to national recognition as an expert in water quality and regulatory matters. Specific areas of expertise include: water supply management; pilot and full-scale process evaluations; treatment plant and distribution system operations; drinking water laboratory management; regulatory analysis and implementation of measures to achieve regulatory compliance; customer service expertise; significant experience in media relations; development of water quality-related communications pieces including Consumer Confidence Reports; and 20 years of dealing with issues related to radionuclides and radon in water supplies. Kevin currently serves on two AWWA regulatory advisory groups dealing with current and developing regulations.\r\nRelevant Project Experience \r\nTampa Bay Water Regional Surface Water Treatment Plan Facility Modification – Transition Plan \r\nOngoing\r\nReview and development of the start-up and commissioning plan for the expansion of the Tampa Bay Water Surface Water Treatment Facility from a capacity of 99 million gallons per day to 120 million gallons per day.

Schweizer, P.E.\r\nSUMMARY OF EXPERIENCE\r\nMr. Schweizer has 28 years of experience in environmental engineering, remedial design, remediation field operations, engineering management, construction and process development. Mr. Schweizer has extensive experience in the design and implementation of remedial actions for groundwater and soil, and in negotiation for site closure under federal, state, and local regulations.\r\nHe is an expert at applying remedial technologies for the cleanup of virtually all types of media and contaminants, including volatile organic compounds (VOCs), petroleum and its products, corrosives, toxic metals petrochemicals, pesticides, PCBs, etc. Most recently John served as Technical Advisor at a major superfund site, and was instrumental in providing Remedial Investigation (RI) review comments that led to additional risk assessment and investigation of soil and groundwater pathway issues at the site that had been previously not completely investigated. He is currently reviewing Feasibility Study (FS) drafts, and providing comments on remedial alternatives to improve efficiency and reduce cost. His efforts have contributed to excellent community relations with the local community and the USEPA, and to trust and respect among the stakeholders involved.\r\nEDUCATION:\r\nM.S., Chemical Engineering, University of California at Berkeley, 1970 B.S., Chemical Engineering, Stanford University, 1968\r\nREGISTRATIONS:\r\nProfessional Engineer registered in California Licensed Contractor, California\r\nCERTIFICATIONS AND/OR SPECIAL TRAINING:\r\n40-hour OSHA training in compliance with 29 CFR 1910.120 8-hour OSHA Refresher Course in Health and Safety for Hazardous Waste Site Operations 8-hour OSHA supervisors training course Certified Asbestos Contractor/Supervisor\r\nPROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS:\r\nA summary of Mr. Schweizer’s professional experience includes:\r\n?UST Site Investigation and Remediation, Berkeley, California. Mr. Schweizer responded within 24 hours to the discovery of a trench filled with oil and soil sludge at a former UST site. The site was a former auto repair facility with a gasoline storage tank that had historically been used for retail sales of leaded and unleaded gasoline. The trench was uncovered during development of the site as a mini-mall. John provided extensive documentation to the owner for review by the lead agency. He reviewed previous UST investigation and removal reports, conducted additional soil and groundwater sampling and testing, and negotiated “No Further Action Required” with the responsible local agency with respect to soil and groundwater contamination. Waste materials in the trench were sampled and analyzed for waste characterization, and properly disposed under federal,\r\nstate and local regulations. The trench was demolished. Demolition debris and soil from site development was sampled, analyzed, characterized and properly disposed as non-hazardous industrial waste under California Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) and local regulations.\r\n?Technical Adviser, AMCO Chemical Superfund Site, Oakland, California. Mr. Schweizer provided technical consulting and community relations support for the Remedial Investigation (RI) phase of a major Superfund project, and are continuing to provide these services during the Feasibility Study (FS) phase. Work has included participation at Community Action Group (CAG) meetings and preparation of newsletters. He has attended and manned an information booth at all EPA–sponsored community outreach events. John also prepared documents for public review. Other work included reporting to the community on review of historical site investigation reports, quarterly groundwater data, air sampling data, RI report, preparation of comments for agency review, and recommendations for remedial technologies to include in the FS. He also prepared a Risk Assessment (RA) study using California DTSC standards, and reviewed the RA prepared for the RI. John’s efforts on this project have built a high level of trust and confidence among a largely minority population.\r\n?San Jose, California NPL Site Mr. Schweizer was responsible for the management and coordination of all site activities related to facility closure. Investigative activities included soil and groundwater sampling and analysis of suspected source areas, the preparation of Closure Plans for submittal to DTSC, and the preparation of Closure Reports. Remediation of VOCs included a 10,000-gallon per minute (gpm) groundwater extraction and treatment system, soil excavation, a slurry wall to contain the source area, and (at the time) the largest SVE system to have been constructed in the US. Project manager for closure of RCRA permitted facilities at the site. Negotiated a risk-based closure standard with the DTSC to replace "no impact", background-based standard in soils naturally containing heavy metal contaminants of concern, including chromium.

Early childhood lower respiratory illness and air pollution.  Environ Health Persp Perspect 115(10):1510-8. PMID: 17938744.  Early childhood bronchitis is a major cause of morbidity and a common reason for missed work days of parents.  Higher ambient levels of fine particles and PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) during the previous month were found to increase the risk of bronchitis, after adjusting for temperature, season, and a host of maternal and household exposures. \r\n \r\nAshwood P, Kwong C, Hansen R, Hertz-Picciotto I, Croen L, Krakowiak P, Walker W, Pessah IN, Van de Water J (2008).

Paediatr Perinatal Epidemiol 22(3):202-13.  Previous reports suggested that PCB exposures during gestation may be associated with lower birth weight, with several studies suggesting boys to be more susceptible to this effect.  A highly exposed cohort of over 1000 children was examined, and boys of Roma ethnicity were found to have lower birth weight if PCB exposures were high. As the Roma are a socially disadvantaged ethnic minority, these results suggest that social disadvantage may increase vulnerability to the toxic effects of PCBs.  \r\n \r\nPalkovicova L, Ursinyova M, Hladikova V, Yu Z, Hertz-Picciotto I (2008).

A variety of previous reports have suggested that 15% or more of children with autism experienced some form of regression, i.e., loss of skills.  This evaluation of children in the CHARGE study found that up to 41% of children with autism either lost social skills or language. \r\nKrakowiak, P, Goodlin-Jones B, Croen LA, Hertz-Picciotto I, Hansen RL (2008 Jun).

A cohort study of in utero polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) exposures in relation to secondary sex ratio.  Environ Health (in press).  PCBs are endocrine disrupting chemicals that are pervasive in the environment, even though they were banned several decades ago.  This project found that mothers with higher levels of PCBs circulating in the bloodstream were less likely to deliver a boy.  Although these chemicals are slowsly declining, other endocrine disruptors with similar chemical structures and toxicity, such as brominated flame retardants, are increasing in our environment.   \r\n\r\nVan Meter KC, Christiansen LE, Hertz-Picciotto I, Azari R, Carpenter T (2008).

Maternal stress and preterm birth.  Amer J Epidemiol 157:14-24, 2003. Preterm birth puts an infant at higher risk for some developmental outcomes, and is often also a marker for unfavorable intrauterine circumstances. This study observed that women with higher levels of psychological anxiety experienced a higher rate of preterm delivery, providing some, albeit limited, evidence that maternal mental state is important to fetal development.\r\n\r\nHertz-Picciotto I, Trnovec T, Kocan T, Charles MJ, Inar P, Langer P, Sovikova E, James R.

This paper describes a recently launched epidemiologic study of a population with exposures to PCBs that are among the highest in the world. This prospective cohort study will follow approximately 1200 children from two towns in eastern Slovakia, measure prenatal exposure from serum specimens, and conduct neurodevelopmental and immunologic tests at various time points from birth through the first few years of life.  It will be the largest study of its type to date, and addresses key aspects of neuro- and immuno-development in human populations.\r\n\r\nO'Neill MS, Hertz-Picciotto I, Pastore LM, Weatherly B.

Lower birthweight associated with maternal exposure to moderate levels of arsenic in drinking water.  Epidemiology 14:593-602, 2003. This study of pregnancy outcome was conducted in two areas of Chile, one in the north, where levels of arsenic have been consistently elevated, and one in the south, where arsenic in drinking water is minimal.  Children in the northern region, which historically was more affluent, experienced lower birth weight, after adjustment for numerous contribution and confounding factors.  This investigation followed up an earlier study of the same region that examined time trends and indicated a possible role of arsenic exposure in increasing fetal and infant mortality.\r\n\r\nRenwick AG, Barlow SM, Hertz-Picciotto I, Boobis AR, Dybing E, Edler L, Eisenbrand G, Greig JB, Kleiner J, Lambe J, Muller DJG, Smith MR, Tritscher A, Tuijtelaars S, van den Brandt PA, Walker R, Kroes R.

Sources of calcium among white and African-American pregnant women.  J Amer Coll Nutr 23(1):43-50, 2004. In a low-income urban study population of about 50% white and 50% African-American, over 1/3 of the pregnant women were consuming less than the RDA (recommended daily allowance) for calcium, and about 1/4 were below the AI (adequate intake) level of 1000 mg/day.  Six percent were consuming less than 600 mg/day, and  younger women were at the highest risk for inadequate calcium. \r\n\r\nRichardson DB, Wing S, Lorey F, Hertz-Picciotto I. Adult Hemoglobin Levels at Birth and Risk of SIDS.  Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine 158:366-371, 2004.   \r\nThis study demonstrated a clear dose-response relationship in which the lower the percentage of adult hemoglobin in the infant's blood, the greater the risk for death from SIDS.  Using a population-based sample of over 3 million births in California and the newborn blood spots collected by the state's Newborn Screening Program, we found that the adult hemoglobin at the time of birth predicted a later SIDS event.  The importance of this investigation is that it provides the strongest indication to date that hematologic events in the prenatal period are related to SIDS.\r\n\r\nDole N, Savitz DA, Siega-Riz AM, Hertz-Picciotto I, McMahon M, Buekens P. Psychosocial factors and preterm birth among African-American and White women in central North Carolina.  Amer J Pub Health 94:1358-1365, 2004.   This study surveyed 1898 women who used university and public health prenatal clinics regarding various psychosocial factors. The results indicated that African Americans were at higher risk of preterm birth if they used distancing from problems as a coping mechanism or reported racial discrimination. Whites were at higher risk if they had high counts of negative life events or were not living with a partner. The association of pregnancy-related anxiety with preterm birth weakened when medical comorbidities were taken into account. No association with preterm birth was found for depression, general social support, or church attendance.\r\n\r\nHertz-Picciotto I (Chair), Berhane KT, Bleecker ML, Engstrom PF, Fenske RA, Gasiewicz TA, Guidotti TL, Koller LD, Stegeman JJ, Strogatz DS [Committee to review the health effects in Vietnam Veterans of exposure to herbicides (Fourth Biennial Update)], Veterans and Agent Orange, Update 2000.

Her experience and training have given her a broad background in cell biology, physiology, and specifically in mammalian immunology and the diseases that develop when immune responses are abnormal.\r\n\r\nOur lab focuses on autoimmune responses, which is when our immune system causes or contributes to tissue damage, leading to autoimmune diseases. Systemic autoimmune diseases appear to be increasing in prevalence worldwide, and one possibility is that this is being driven by environmental exposures, in concert with genetic factors. It is well known that silica exposure is associated with increased risk of systemic autoimmune diseases such as lupus, scleroderma, and rheumatoid arthritis, but much less is known about autoimmune responses with asbestos exposure. The asbestos exposures that occurred in Libby MT due to vermiculite mining has provided us with an opportunity to explore that association and the cellular/molecular mechanisms that drive autoimmunity and subsequent pathologies. We hypothesize that the molecular structure or intracellular localization of autoantigens is modified through oxidative or apoptotic processes, improperly exposing them to the immune system and inducing production of autoantibodies to those antigens. Possible outcomes of the autoantibodies are a) systemic autoimmune diseases, or b) worsening of the lung damage leading to fibrosis and pleural disease. We are also trying to discover exactly what the targets are for those autoantibodies, and how they might modify cellular function to exacerbate tissue damage. Such discoveries could lead us to novel treatments for these devastating diseases.	2015-02-27 05:24:54.739128	2015-02-27 05:24:54.739128	398

She has worked in a variety of hospitals and settings including staff nurse, CCU manager, and nursing supervisor. In 1990 she moved to Libby, MT working part-time at St. Johns Lutheran Hospital as a staff nurse and resource for the 3-bed intensive care unit.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 2000, Ms. Cohan accepted an HRSA-funded position as pulmonary health nurse to coordinate aspects of a program to provide screening for people with asbestos exposure. As the Outreach Coordinator for the ATSDR's screening of over 6,000 individuals in the summer of 2000, Ms. Cohan provided educational information, urgent referrals for respondents, and acted as a liaison between patients, physicians, government agencies, and community groups.\r\n\r\nAs the magnitude of the healthcare issues related to the asbestos exposure in Libby became apparent, Ms. Cohan oversaw the creation and formation of a clinic for asbestos related disease in Libby. The clinic now provides medical diagnosis, referrals, patient education, staff development, and community education on the effects of asbestos exposure.	2015-02-27 05:24:54.827081	2015-02-27 05:24:54.827081	399

Dioxins are one of most worrisome classes of these toxicants and can decrease fertility by interfering with ovulation. In addition to preventing ovulation at quite low doses, dioxins exhibit chemoprotective properties for some hormone-dependent cancers. Research goals are to understand the mechanisms of dioxin action on the female reproductive system and develop novel compounds that retain the contraceptive and chemoprotective properties of dioxins while avoiding their toxicities. In addition to this reproductive toxicology and contraception research program, I collaborate to investigate the role of Src tyrosine kinase in ovarian follicular development.	2015-02-27 05:24:55.148662	2015-02-27 05:24:55.148662	404

B cells are an important effector cell in maintaining immunity against a wide variety of pathogens. B cells produce and secrete antibodies which have the ability to recognize specific antigens (i.e., foreign molecules) and lead to the clearance of these antigens from the body. B cells and antibodies therefore play an important role in host protection. Exposure to exogenous chemicals either through the diet, pharmaceuticals or environment may impair immune function. TCDD (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin or dioxin) has been identified as a potent suppressor of B cell function by markedly inhibiting antibody secretion. This is of human relevance and toxicological interest since TCDD is only one representative of a large class of environmental chemicals. The toxic effects of these chemicals may be mediated through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signaling pathway.\r\n\r\nSelected Publications\r\nPeer-reviewed publications\r\n\r\nHenseler, R.A., Romer, E.J., Sulentic, C.E.W.: Chemical-induced Modulation of the 3’IgH regulatory region in the CH12.LX Cell Line: an in vitro Model for Identifying Immunotoxicants that Target B Cell Function.

Todd Boulevard		Nashville	TN	37208	0	Associate Professor, Director of Cancer Biology	Meharry Medical College, Department of Cancer Biology	0	(Source: http://www.mmc.edu/faculty/som-seltom.html) \r\n\r\nThe research in Dr. Eltom’s laboratory is investigating how particular environmental chemicals cause cancer of certain organs but not others.  Specifically, they are looking at how the chemical dioxin causes cancers of the liver, skin, thyroid, etc., but appears to be protective of breast cancer.  This chemical exerts its functions through binding to a cellular protein called the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR).  By defining how this receptor functions in the presence and absence of dioxin in these different tissues, Dr. Eltom and her colleagues hope to identify the underlying mechanisms responsible for these differential responses.  Their studies involve primary cultures of human mammary epithelial cells and breast carcinoma cell lives.  Recent studies on human tumors have revealed a possible novel mechanism by which the AhR provokes cancer progression the absence of environmental carcinogenesis like dioxin.\r\n\r\nAnother project in this laboratory is investigating the role of a group of environmental chemicals that mimics hormones (i.e., endrocrine disruptors) and their possible contribution to the incidence in breast cancer in pre-menopausal women.\r\n\r\nSelected Publications:\r\n\r\nEltom SE, Dale Y.

The cause of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-r-dioxin-induced death in rats is a combination of appetite suppression and inhibition of gluconeogenesis, whereas in mice it appears to be inhibition of gluconeogenesis alone, leading to a lethal hypoglycemia. Currently three lines of research are being pursued: 1) elucidation of the molecular mechanism(s) of action leading to CAH-induced enzyme inhibition; 2) investigation of the subchronic and chronic toxicities of TCDD and its higher chlorinated homologues as well as other heterocyclic analogues such as chlorinated phenothiazines (CPT), and 3) studying female reproductive toxicity of both CAH and CPT.\r\n\r\nSelected Publications:\r\n\r\nUshinohama, K., Son, D.-S., Roby, K.F., Rozman, K.K. and Terranova, P.F.: Impaired ovulation by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-r-dioxin (TCDD) in immature rats treated with equine chorionic gonadotropin.

We have focused our efforts on understanding the molecular mechanisms that these animals use in their response and how this compares to those in higher animals, including humans. By understanding the differences and similarities in how phylogenetically diverse organisms respond to environmental exposure, we may be better able to assess the risks to environmental and human health. Research in my laboratory is directed along three related lines of investigation: (1) the investigation of molecular events in tumorigenesis in a small aquarium fish, the Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) exposed to known mammalian carcinogens; (2) the analysis of tumors of the reproductive system in the soft-shell clam, Mya arenaria and (3) the biological effects of dioxin exposure in aquatic organisms exposed to pulp mill effluents and pesticides. In all of these studies, we are using aquatic models to study molecular mechanisms of environmentally-induced toxicity/carcinogenicity and the complex interactions of the genetic and environmental factors involved.\r\n\r\nPublications\r\n\r\n    * Kelley, M.L. and Van Beneden, R.J.

Research in Dr. Cassis’ laboratory aims to identify mechanisms linking obesity to cardiovascular disease. Dr. Cassis’ laboratory made the pivotal finding in 1988 that angiotensin II, the primary peptide of the renin-angiotensin system, is produced by adipocytes. Current studies examine adipose derived angiotensin peptides as a mediator of the cardiovascular complications of obesity (i.e., hypertension, atherosclerosis, abdominal aortic aneurysms). High fat feeding is used to produce diet-induced obesity in rodents, and adipose-derived angiotensins are studied in conjunction with cardiovascular disease. Mechanisms for regulation of adipose angiotensin production by high cholesterol and/or high fat feeding are under study, including differences in the regional production of angiotensin by visceral versus subcutaneous adipose tissue. In addition, Dr. Cassis’ laboratory is studying how environmental toxins, such as the highly lipophilic PCBs accumulate in adipose tissue and influence adipocyte biology. Results from these studies will identify novel medical approaches to treat obesity-related disorders.\r\n\r\n	2015-02-27 05:24:59.067541	2015-02-27 05:24:59.067541	438

As an environmental/process engineering specialist, he is knowledgeable in regulatory and permitting issues.  Mr. Maxwell has also managed the planning and design of numerous water and wastewater treatment projects, including pilot plant studies to select among alternative technologies and optimize design parameters.  This includes alternate deliver (design-build) projects as well.\r\nRelevant Project Experience\r\nWastewater Facility Planning for the Metro Wastewater Reclamation District in Commerce City, Colorado\r\nProject Manager – In the mid-1980s, Mark developed the 201 Facility Plan and Preliminary Design Report for the nitrification and denitrification improvements to Metro’s Robert W. Hite Wastewater Treatment Plant, which is currently (in 2008) rated for an annual average flow of 161 mgd.  To meet ammonia and nitrate limits, Mark developed a plan to incorporate anoxic reactors and mixed liquor recycle pumping into the existing three-pass air activated sludge aeration basins in the 70 mgd North Complex.  Centrate from dewatering of anaerobically digested sludge, which can contain up to 2000 mg-N/L of ammonia, is flow-equalized and then routed directly to the North Complex aeration basins for ammonia and nitrate removal.  A small slipstream of non-nitrified secondary effluent from the South Complex is blended into the North Complex effluent to make sure there is sufficient ammonia for chloramine disinfection.  \r\nIn 2008, Mark led the team that updated Metro’s Facility Plan, which was also configured so it will serve as the five-year update of the Utility Plan that is maintained by the Denver Regional Council of Governments.  The 2008 Update forecasts capacity, compliance, and fixed asset replacement needs in five-year increments.  Predesign of the largest project to emerge from the 2008 Update was initiated before the report was completed.  This project is replacement of the pure oxygen reactors in the South Complex with a new three-stage air activated sludge system designed for nitrification, first-stage denitrification, and biological phosphorous removal for an annual average flow of 100 mgd.  Trace amounts of ammonia will be fed to the fully nitrified North and South Complex secondary effluents so chloramine disinfection can be continued.  Annual cash flow requirements were projected through 2017 (10 years), and in five year increments through 2033.  Capital expenditures were projected to be over $800 million during the first 10 years, and over $1.8 billion through the entire 25-year planning period.     \r\nOther MWRD assignments include a mixing study for the anaerobic digesters; an investigation into the causes and solutions to the District’s consistently low effluent pH; and expansion of the primary treatment facilities, which includes conversion to the thin sludge pumping mode of operation and installation of separate gravity thickeners.\r\nRegulatory Support, Snake River Wastewater Utility and Frisco Sanitation District, Summit County, Colorado\r\nProject Manager - Working with Dr. William Lewis of the University of Colorado over a 10-year period, Mark developed an Alternatives Analysis approach to complying with Anti-Degradation Rule requirements for WWTP discharges to Lake Dillon.  Through a rigorous mixing zone analysis, \r\nDr. Lewis and B&V were able to demonstrate that ammonia removal should not be a permit requirement and an alternative copper standard will fully protect the lake without the need for supplemental reverse osmosis heavy metal removal treatment at the two WWTPs.  This work culminated in the spring of 2005 with the State’s acceptance of the Alternatives Analysis reports and issuance of discharge permit amendments to reflect their results.\r\nWWTP Process and Regulatory Support, South Adams County Water and Sanitation District, Commerce City, Colorado\r\nProcess and Regulatory Specialist - In the spring of 2005, Mark provided process and regulatory direction for a Capacity Analysis and Re-Rating Study of the Williams-Monaco WWTP.  Interim re-rating of the plant from 7.0 to 8.0 mgd is needed to accommodate growth and bridge the period between now and the year when a regional WWTP comes on line.  Re-rating is possible because performance of the MBBR process is better than predicted when design of this new technology was completed in 2002.  In addition, a performance review and modeling of the existing biotower indicates it can achieve substantial ammonia removal at flows up to 2.5 mgd.  The State awarded site application approval of the re-rating request in 2006, and the interim increase in capacity will be incorporated into the 2008 renewal of the discharge permit.  When the regional plant is on-line, the design maximum month flow for the Williams-Monaco facility will drop to 6.0 mgd, which must be further upgraded to meet the pending nitrate waste load allocation for Segment 15 of the South Platte River.\r\nPotable Water Supply Project, Town of Lyons, Colorado\r\nProject Manager - Mark provided technical and managerial direction for a new finished water pumping station and transmission line project by which the Town of Lyons conveys potable water from City of Longmont.  This project allowed the Town to decommission, rather than upgrade, its aging WTP.  Three, 100-horsepower and adjustable speed pumps deliver finished water through a 12-inch high pressure transmission main to the Town’s upper pressure zone.  Permits and approvals for this project, which was financed with a state revolving loan, were required from numerous local, state, and federal agencies, including the Corps of Engineers and the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service.  Mark helped the Town select a construction manager and negotiate a guaranteed maximum price for the work.  He also assisted the Town in negotiating its initial tap fee and intergovernmental agreement with Longmont.\r\nUV Disinfection Project, City of Bozeman, Montana\r\nProject Manager - Working with Great West Engineering, Black & Veatch prepared a preliminary design report (PDR) for conversion from gaseous chlorine and sulfur dioxide to UV disinfection at the WWTP that serves the City of Bozeman, Montana.  Integral to conversion to UV is the need for the City to have an alternate form of chlorine for odor and activated sludge filament control, plus a larger and more reliable standby generator.  Key features of the preliminary design include:\r\n•\tShould effluent quality improve through the future use of advanced nutrient removal technologies, the initial 14.4 mgd UV capacity may be sufficient to meet the 25 mgd ultimate design condition.\r\n•\tWith some code-compliance modifications, the existing garage can be converted to an economical site for a sodium hypochlorite system, and is conveniently located so chlorine solution can be distributed through the same network of feed piping.\r\n•\tThe distribution of standby power to controllable loads will be through the plant SCADA system, and the restart sequence will be prioritized to maintain continuous operations and make best use of generator capacity.\r\nDue to funding and timing considerations, the City elected to defer these improvements and will integrate them into a larger biological nutrient removal (BNR) upgrade and expansion. \r\n2003 Water/Wastewater Master Plan, Cheyenne Board of Public Utilities, Cheyenne, Wyoming\r\nProject Manager - Managed the preparation of a comprehensive Master Plan that encompassed all utility functions, from water supply, treatment, and distribution to wastewater collection, treatment, and ultimate utilization of the final effluent and biosolids.  Other elements included development of short and long-term demand management (conservation) measures, and evaluation of the BOPU’s non-potable water supply (including wastewater reuse) and financial planning systems.  Even the size and makeup of the BOPU’s workforce was considered in this master planning effort.  Computer models that were developed to assist in analysis and decision-making include the following:\r\n•\tStrategic water supply system model to predict surface water yields under alternative snow pack scenarios.  This model is also used to forecast whether the BOPU will be entering/leaving one of five defined drought conditions based on projected surface water yields, ground water pumping, system-wide demands, and the use of non-potable water supplies, such as raw surface water and reclaimed wastewater, at major greenbelt sites.\r\n•\tWater distribution system model to identify existing and future deficiencies and develop recommended improvements to ensure water is delivered at adequate pressure and volume to where it is needed.  An “all-pipes” model was developed to refine the analysis and provide comprehensive maintenance management database.  \r\n•\tWastewater collection system model to help ensure that adequate capacity is available throughout the BOPU’s service area.  While an “all pipes” model was developed for maintenance purposes, the hydraulic analysis was run on a sub-set of the pipe network that comprises the major lateral, trunk, and interceptor lines.\r\n•\tFinancial planning models for both the water and wastewater funds.  Black & Veatch helped the BOPU develop prioritized capital improvement programs and the rate increases needed to implement them.  \r\nDuring the course of the study, it became apparent that wastewater reuse should be a component of the BOPU’s future water supply system.  Accordingly, reclaimed wastewater treatment facilities were designed as bid alternative to a concurrent project to upgrade and expand both WWTPs.  Final copies of the Master Plan, including figures, were delivered to the BOPU in both hard copy and CD format.\r\nSherard Raw Water Delivery Pipeline, Cheyenne Board of Public Utilities, Cheyenne, Wyoming\r\nProject Manager - Managed the design and construction of 14.0 miles of \r\n36-inch diameter, cathodically protected pipe to deliver raw water from Crystal Reservoir to the new Sherard WTP.  The new conduit generally runs parallel to an existing 30-inch line, which could not meet maximum day production requirements for the new WTP.  Due to strong competition between steel and ductile iron pipe suppliers, construction bids were more than $3 million under budget, allowing Cheyenne to install more of the line than it anticipated during this phase of the project.  Black & Veatch and its subcontractors successfully handled a wide array of permitting, easement, environmental, and property owner issues, helping the contractor to deliver the project ahead of schedule.\r\nUpgrade and Expansion of the Crow Creek and Dry Creek WRFs for the Cheyenne Board of Public Utilities in Cheyenne, Wyoming\r\nProject Manager - Managed two projects to upgrade and expand the two water reclamation facilities (WRFs) that serve the Cheyenne Board of Public Utilities (BOPU).  Construction of the first project was completed in 2001, and the second in 2006.\r\n•\t2001 Expansion of the Crow Creek WRF.  This rock media trickling filter facility, most of which was first constructed in 1949, was expanded from 4.5 to 6.5 mgd.  Features include replacement of the original screening, grit removal, and primary clarification equipment, plus renovation of the headworks building to meet current codes.  In addition, the design provided for retrofit of vertical UV disinfection equipment into the chlorine contact basin.\r\n•\t2003 Design of Improvements to the Crow Creek and Dry Creek WRFs.  In 2001, the receiving stream (Crow Creek) was reclassified by the State for aquatic life protection, which required that ammonia removal be provided at both plants.  Based on cost evaluations and pilot plant studies, it was recommended that the nitrification capacity of the Dry Creek WRF be expanded to 10.5 mgd by conversion of the existing aeration basins to an integrated fixed film activated sludge (IFAS) process, and inclusion of mixed liquor recycle pumping and pre-denitrification basins.  The IFAS conversion was accomplished through the addition of buoyant plastic carrier elements, a new diffused aeration system, and stainless steel sieves to retain the media within the aeration basins.  Similar to the 2001 project at the Crow Creek WRF, the Dry Creek design provided for retrofit of vertical UV disinfection equipment into the chlorine contact basin.\r\nThe Crow Creek WRF has always been a fixed film facility and the BOPU wants to retain a simple biological treatment process so this plant could be staffed with a minimum complement of operators, and run unattended at night.  As a result, B&V recommended that the trickling filters be replaced with a MBBR system.  This process uses the plastic carrier elements, diffused aeration system, and sieves, but there is no recycle of solids from the secondary clarifiers.  The MBBR process is a once-through biological system and the BOPU can continue to use their shallow secondary clarifiers since the waste sludge is similar to the slough from trickling filters.\r\nCapacity Expansion and Regulatory Upgrade for the Project 7 Water Authority, Montrose, Colorado\r\nProject Manager – In 2000, Mark managed and provided technical direction for a study to reassess the adequacy of the existing WTP to meet future capacity and regulatory requirements.  Raw surface water, which is diverted from the Gunnison River, is stored in a small terminal reservoir prior to coagulation, solids contact sludge blanket clarification, and dual media filtration.  The study indicated that short-term capacity requirements could be met by renovating the two oldest filters.  Due to the far flung nature of its service area, near-term regulatory compliance recommendations focused on improving free chlorine contact time and reducing distribution system disinfection byproducts by adding ammonium sulfate to create a chloramine residual.\r\nIn response to record water demands, Project 7 retained Black & Veatch in 2008 to provide a design-build expansion and upgrade of the WTP from 18.6 to 27.6 mgd.  While a membrane addition was considered, economics and operational issues favored the addition of two more granular media filters.  Other elements of the project include construction of a new, well-baffled chlorine contact basin to replace an aging reservoir and to meet the State’s new disinfection requirements, which will now mirror those of EPA.  In addition, the plastic tube settlers had reached the end of their useful life and will be replaced.  The guaranteed maximum of $8.9 million was about $0.4 million under budget and includes a shared savings provision which could result in a further reduction in cost to the Owner.  Black & Veatch committed to complete the project in less than one year so the additional capacity will be available for the peak demand season in 2009.     \r\nWastewater Master Plan, Cheyenne Board of Public Utilities, \r\nCheyenne, Wyoming\r\nProject Manager - Managed comprehensive study of Cheyenne's wastewater collection and treatment systems, including a 201 Facility Plan in 1995, which was updated in 1998 to reflect Wyoming’s proposed new stream reclassification system.  A linked GIS/hydraulic computational model was developed to evaluate the collection system.  This model was also updated in 1998 to reflect the results of a special sewer flow monitoring and rainfall data collection program.  This data enabled Black & Veatch to develop specific infiltration inflow rates for each of the major drainage basins that comprise Cheyenne’s collection system.  Wastewater management alternatives included conventional treatment and discharge, as well as transbasin disposal and wetlands creation in lieu of meeting effluent ammonia limits that could potentially be as low as 0.20 mg-N/L.\r\nLevel I Water Master Plan, Cheyenne Board of Public Utilities, Cheyenne, Wyoming\r\nProject Manager - Directed comprehensive study of Cheyenne's water supply, treatment, and distribution system.  Prepared future potable water demands and revenues considering the impact of programs for water conservation and the substitution of raw water or reclaimed wastewater for potable water currently used to irrigate major park/greenbelt areas.\r\nPilot Plant Study and Preliminary Design Report, Cheyenne Board of Public Utilities, Cheyenne, Wyoming\r\nProject Manager - Directed multiple pilot plant studies to evaluate technology to be incorporated into the expansion of the 18 mgd Sherard WTP, which will increase net throughput capacity to 32 mgd in Phase 1, further expandable to 50 mgd in the future.  Using pilot units supplied by both Black & Veatch and potential equipment suppliers, the following processes were evaluated over multiple seasons to evaluate variable water quality conditions: dissolved air floatation, aided sedimentation, ballasted flocculation, ozone disinfection, microfiltration and dual and mixed media filtration.  Based on a farsighted set of water quality goals developed by the client and Black & Veatch, a recommended set of water treatment processes was selected, for which a preliminary design report was prepared.\r\nWater Reclamation Facility Upgrade and Expansion, City of Broomfield, Colorado\r\nProject Manager - Managed design and construction for the Phase 1 and Phase 2 improvements to the Broomfield WRF.  The $28 million Phase 1 expansion increased capacity from 4 to 8 mgd, went on-line in 2004, and made maximum use of existing aeration basins through the implementation of an Integrated Fixed Film Activated Sludge (IFAS) process.  Through the addition of plastic carrier element media, the IFAS basins will be able to handle twice their original design load while fully nitrifying the flow.  Other project components include:\r\n•\tIFAS pilot study to confirm design loadings and expected performance.\r\n•\tAdditional influent pumping, screening, and primary clarification capacity.\r\n•\tTwo new high solids centrifuges.\r\n•\tAnaerobic and anoxic basins for biological phosphorus and nitrate removal system.\r\n•\tOne more secondary clarifier and a new UV disinfection system to meet more stringent E.Coli requirements.\r\n•\tChemical feed and filtration facilities to produce up to 6 mgd of reclaimed wastewater for reuse.  The reuse water will also meet the City's phosphorous removal objectives for discharge to Great Western Reservoir (GWR), which will become a reuse water storage impoundment.\r\n•\tExpanded odor control system that incorporates a new biofilter.\r\nBlack & Veatch assisted the City of Broomfield with local, regional, and State permitting requirements, which included site approval for the WRF, notice of authorization for the farm site facilities, approval to discharge to GWR, and authorization to apply reclaimed wastewater to reuse sites.  The $27 million Phase 2 project provides for expansion to 12 mgd, and includes more IFAS and UV capacity, a new preliminary treatment complex, major renovation of the anaerobic digester complex, covering the sludge storage lagoon, and expansion of the odor control biofiltration system.  Construction of the Phase 2 improvements is scheduled to be complete in 2010.      \r\nReclaimed Water System, City of Westminster, Colorado\r\nProject Manager - Managed the construction of an $18 million advanced wastewater treatment plant and distribution system to supply 6 mgd of reclaimed wastewater for irrigation of major park, golf course, school, athletic field, streetscape, and business greenbelt areas throughout the City.  The new plant includes chemical coagulation, continuous contact filtration, chlorine disinfection, equalization storage, and high service pumping facilities.  Over 75,000 feet of transmission and service line pipes were installed, along with a companion fiber optics system to provide for SCADA communication between the plant and all reuse sites, where metering and flow control equipment were installed.\r\nWater Reclamation Facility Master Plan, City of Pueblo, Colorado\r\nProject Manager - Managed and provided technical direction for a detailed evaluation of Pueblo's 19 mgd filter/solids contact (TF/SC) contact treatment plant.  Task 1 focused on evaluating the major unit processes considering design, regulatory, hydraulic, operational, and redundancy factors.  In \r\nTask 2, B&V developed alternatives to eliminate capacity bottlenecks and prepared a staged and prioritized capital improvements program (CIP) for the WRF.\r\nThe first CIP project to be implemented was renovation of the headworks, which became operational in 2004.  New facilities include step screens and washing/compaction equipment to clean and dewater the screenings.  The compactor was designed and specified to successfully push the compacted screenings over 50 feet to an existing truck loading bay.  Two types of raw wastewater pumps were added as well.  Vertical centrifugal units were installed in the new building to augment screw pumps.  During construction, one of the enclosed screw pumps became inoperable.  The City elected to retire this unit and B&V designed two submersible pumps to replace it, which were installed as a change order without disruption to the schedule.\r\nB&V was also asked by the City to design two interceptor sewer replacement projects.  The first was for a segment of the City's 30 inch corrugated metal pipe interceptor sewer.  A portion of this interceptor lies along and under the Arkansas River.  Installation of the new 36- and 42-inch corrosion-resistant HOBAS pipe was completed in 2004.  Project permitting and construction scheduling was closely coordinated with numerous local, state, and Federal agencies.  The project was financed through a low interest state loan that B&V helped the City secure.  The second project involved upsizing of the Northern Interceptor, which required two tunnels, one of them under I-25.  Consisting of 21-inch HOBAS pipe, the first phase of this project will allow the City to handle flows from the more rapidly growing northern sector of the City, while buying time for Pueblo to generate the funds needed to upsize lower portions of this line.   \r\nWater Quality and Treatment Consultation, City of Golden, Colorado\r\nProject Manager - In response to a boil order from the State of Colorado, the City of Golden asked Mark to lead a team of B&V specialists and restore the normally excellent performance of its WTP.  The City’s WTP, which treats surface water from Clear Creek, had experienced simultaneous failures in its coagulation, manganese removal, and granular media filtration processes.  By switching coagulants and adjusting the City’s manganese monitoring and oxidation strategy, the WTP was able to quickly come back into compliance.  During the following 3 months, B&V served as the chief plant operator and developed a report to assist the City and its new plant superintendent in improving both the physical facilities and operations at the WTP.\r\nStrategic and Forward Planning Studies, City of Henderson, Nevada\r\nProject Engineer - In 1997, in response to growth rates in excess of \r\n10 percent per year, Mark developed a fast-track Strategic Plan to double the biological capacity of the Wastewater Reclamation Facility (WRF) from \r\n10 to 21 mgd while complying with stringent ammonia and phosphorous removal standards.  These Bridging Capacity Improvements, the unit costs for which are under $0.80 per gpd, were placed into service in the fall of 1998.  They provided the time for Henderson to plan, design, and stage additional improvements to its advanced waste treatment plant.  This facility must meet stringent nutrient standards for discharge to Lake Mead, and pathogen standards for landscape reuse sites.\r\nMark subsequently prepared a Forward Planning Study, the intent of which was to enable the City to increase capacity and meet regulatory requirements in a timely and logical manner.  Design of the recommended project, the Phase 3 improvements, was completed in 2000.  However, due to site acquisition delays, construction of the Phase 3 project was delayed until 2004.  Accordingly, another interim capacity project, further increasing the WRF capacity to 24 mgd, was conceived in 2001 and placed into service in 2003.\r\nThe Phase 3 improvements were completed in 2007 and resulted in a 32-mgd complex that provides for full biological nutrient removal with chemical treatment and filtration for polishing of effluent phosphorous residuals.  Low pressure/high output UV equipment provides for disinfection of all flows to pathogen standards suitable for discharge to Lake Mead.  That portion of the effluent pumped to reuse through a multi-zone distribution system receives supplemental chloramination by means of sodium hypochlorite and sodium bisulfite.  Waste biological and chemical solids are dewatered using belt filter process and hauled by a private contractor to a local landfill.\r\nIn 2008, Mark led the development of an executive summary briefing document regarding emerging contaminants of potential concern in the Las Vegas Valley.  In addition to the trace organic compounds that are being scrutinized worldwide for their potential endocrine disrupting characteristics, selenium loads to Lake Mead are being evaluated on a regional and statewide basis.  The summary includes forecasting emerging contaminant removals, including the impact of potential supplemental treatment processes as the Henderson WRF may be modified in the future to meet more stringent regulatory requirements.  The executive summary will be used by City officials during discussions with regional and state water quality agencies and will be updated and incorporated into the 2009 Update of the WRF Master Plan.        \r\nWater Distribution, Stormwater, and Wastewater Collection System Master Plan Updates, Casper Public Services, Casper, Wyoming\r\nProject Manager - Managed the preparation of the 1997 updates to the computer models and master plans for the entire water distribution system and East Casper stormwater collection facilities.  The modeling efforts included utilization of existing GIS and development plans to allocate population and land use to the areas under consideration.  Prioritized capital improvement plans were developed and staged improvements were bracketed to growth milestones.  A preliminary design was also prepared for water facilities needed to serve the rapidly growing East Casper area.  As part of the wastewater collection system study, rain gages and portable flow meters were installed to determine basin-specific infiltration and inflow rates to help calibrate the model to Casper’s site specific conditions.  The collection system model was completed in 2001. \r\nWellhead Protection Plan, Casper Public Utilities, Casper and Natrona County, Wyoming\r\nProject Manager - Developed the scope and managed the preparation of a comprehensive study to expand the CPU's water supply and develop a wellhead protection program to protect local groundwater resources.\r\nLevel II Water Master Plan, Wyoming Water Development Commission; Casper and Natrona County, Wyoming\r\nProject Manager - Black & Veatch prepared the SDWA and WTP assessments and economic evaluation for a regional water supply master plan.  The study developed preliminary design criteria and costs for renovation and expansion of surface and groundwater supply systems to serve a future population of over 80,000 people in more than six communities/districts.\r\nWTP Improvements, City of Glenwood Springs, Colorado\r\nProject Manager - Managed a site evaluation study and design of coagulation, flocculation, and plate settling improvements to an 8.6 mgd \r\nin-line filtration WTP.  Raw water, which is derived from several creeks that drain the Flattops Watershed, is subject to seasonal turbidity spikes.  The original plant could not handle these spikes, resulting in reduced throughput and passage of Giardia cysts into the finished water.  The new pretreatment facilities were successfully built on a steeply sloping, geotechnically challenging site adjacent to the original filtration plant.  The project also included a backwash equalization basin, control valve, and sewer line to convey WTP residuals to the City’s WWTP.\r\nWastewater Facility Plan and Treatment Plant Design, Town of Berthoud, Colorado\r\nProject Manager - Managed and provided technical process engineering support for the preparation of a 201 Facility Plan and design of a 2.0 mgd WWTP.  The new facility, which is expandable to 3.0 mgd, utilizes a plug flow, nitrifying activated sludge treatment train with disinfection provided by self-cleaning, low pressure/high output UV lamp modules.  The site was laid out to facilitate the future addition of biological phosphorous and nitrate removal.  If needed, chemical addition and filtration can be added to achieve (1) low phosphorous residuals prior to discharge or (2) reclaimed wastewater for landscape reuse.  Black & Veatch also helped the Town complete the site approval applications required by both the State and Weld County.  Other services included preparation of a draft FNSI for use by the State in approving the project and making it eligible for a low-interest SRF loan. \r\nWastewater Treatment Plant Improvements, Summit County Board of Commissioners, Summit County, Colorado\r\nProject Manager - Since 1976, Mark has provided technical direction and management for three Facility Plans and seven expansions or modifications to the Snake River WWTP.  This facility provides an extraordinary high degree of phosphorous removal prior to discharge to Lake Dillon.  Unit processes include plug flow activated sludge; flow equalization; sodium hydroxide, alum, and polymer addition; flocculation; aided sedimentation; and mixed media filtration.  Filtered effluent turbidity and total phosphorous residuals are typically less than 0.25 NTU and 20 µg-P/L, respectively.  Waste biological and chemical sludges are aerobically digested prior to centrifuge dewatering and composting at the nearby County landfill.  The sixth expansion project was completed in 2002 and increased overall WWTP capacity to handle buildout flows, which are expected to be 2.6 mgd.  While supplemental disinfection has not been necessary or utilized for the last 20 years, a medium pressure in-vessel UV system was added in 2008 because the State is now applying the anti-degradation rule to Lake Dillon and fecal coliform/E.coli limits are becoming progressively more stringent.  \r\nWastewater Treatment Plant and Interceptor Sewer, City of Gunnison, Colorado\r\nProject Manager - Managed the completion of a 201 Facility Plan and design of a 4.2-mgd oxidation ditch plant and 13,000 feet of 27-inch interceptor sewer.  The recommended plan provided for abandonment of the City’s WWTP, as well as the aerated lagoon facility that served the County’s \r\nDos Rios Sanitation District.  The Dos Rios WWTP site was utilized for construction of the City’s new regional facility, which serves the City and County customers that have municipal sewer service.  The new plant uses a variety of special features for Gunnison's high-altitude, cold-weather climate and received innovative and alternative funding from EPA, plus the Consulting Engineer’s Council design award in 1988.\r\nThe 1983 Facility Plan was further updated in both 1998 and 2001 as part of City/County efforts to connect three small treatment plants, plus numerous septic systems located in high groundwater areas, to the City’s regional WWTP.\r\nWastewater Treatment Plant Improvements, Frisco Sanitation District, Frisco, Colorado\r\nProject Manager - Managed the design of improvements that (1) increased secondary treatment, aerobic sludge digestion, and advanced waste treatment capacity and (2) improved plant safety and reliability. Specific improvements included covered secondary clarifiers, modification of an existing package plant to provide more aeration capacity, and replacement of a decaying wooden roof with a geodesic aluminum dome. AWT capacity was increased by retrofitting adsorption clarification and filtration processes into an unused flocculation/sedimentation complex.  In 2001, Mark managed the retrofit of two high solids centrifuges and shaftless screw conveyors into the existing solids handling building.  In 2008, two secondary effluent flow equalization basins were placed into service.  Smoothing out peak flows eliminated the need to built more AWT units, which were several times more expensive than the new concrete basins and a companion site dewatering system.   \r\nWastewater Treatment Plant Preliminary Design Report, City of Laramie, Wyoming\r\nProject Manager - Managed a 201 Facility Plan and preliminary design report that evaluated both conventional and nonconventional alternatives for expanding capacity and improving performance of the City's wastewater treatment plant.  The recommended plan called for replacement of the City's aerated lagoon and rapid infiltration facilities with an oxidation ditch that will provide for secondary, ammonia removal and denitrification treatment in the same basin.\r\nIron and Manganese Water Treatment Plant, Steamboat Springs Water, Steamboat Springs, Colorado\r\nProject Manager - Provided process expertise for the design of a 2 mgd iron and manganese removal WTP for the Yampa River Infiltration Gallery.  Severe site and building elevation constraints led to the selection of a monomedium anthracite filter with a gravel-less underdrain that provides for both air and water backwash capabilities.\r\nIron and Manganese Water Treatment Plants, Town of Monument, Colorado\r\nProject Manager - Provided process direction and managed the design of facilities to treat high concentrations of iron and manganese in both alluvial and deep, nontributary groundwater.  The more recent Well No. 8 project included in-situ precoating of silica sand instead of using conventional, but less durable, greensand material.\r\nWater and Wastewater Master Plans, City of Longmont, Colorado\r\nProject Manager - Managed the preparation of master plans for Longmont's water treatment and distribution systems, as well as its wastewater collection and treatment facilities.\r\nPublications and Presentations\r\nPhillips, H.

Abitz    513 226-5329\r\n \r\n\r\nProfessional Qualifications\r\n\r\nDr. Abitz is a geochemist with over twenty years of experience in the environmental services sector of private and government organizations.  His broad experience encompasses project and personnel management, analysis of chemical and radiological data, modeling of soil/water systems and radioactive waste streams with experimental methods and geochemical computer codes, risk assessment, and development of remedial work plans for CERCLA and RCRA sites.  His technical expertise includes the application of geochemical principles, experimental methods, and computer models to problems involving the solubility and mobility of hazardous and radioactive elements in the environment, evaluation of environmental and human risk associated with exposure to contaminants in air, soil and water media, remediation techniques for waters and soil contaminated by hazardous and radioactive wastes, and the design and treatment of mixed and radioactive waste streams.  \r\n\r\nAs an environmental consultant, Dr. Abitz has used his management and project skills and knowledge of geochemical processes to perform and complete project work on a number of high profile milestones.  At the DOE Savannah River Site, he supported the prime contract transition and assisted with the preparation of the $1.6 billion baseline spending package for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA).  As an EPA subcontractor supporting the Bluewater Valley Downstream Alliance, he provides geochemical expertise on groundwater remediation at the Homestake uranium tailings site north of Milan, NM.  For the Navajo and Sioux Nations, and the Goliad County Groundwater Conservation District (Texas), he serves as a technical expert and has evaluated the impact of proposed in situ uranium mining on the community groundwater supply. \r\n\r\nAt the Fernald, Ohio superfund site, Dr. Abitz was the site geochemist responsible for the integration of technical tasks associated with preparing remediation work plans, collecting soil, water and air samples, data validation, data analysis and modeling, in situ measurements for 226Ra, 232Th, and 238U activity using sodium iodide and high-purity germanium detectors, developing an estimate of the Curie inventory for the on-site disposal cell (OSDF), and preparation of the residual risk assessment and soil certification reports. He also served the Fernald site as a senior consultant to the DOE Technology Development Program and managed active research projects at several universities.  These projects included laboratory studies on the mobilization and removal of contaminants from soil/water systems, such as passive removal of uranium from groundwater using inorganic and organic media.\r\n\r\nDr Abitz also has extensive experience at other DOE sites.  At Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), he developed waste analysis and radioactive material management plans for transuranic and low-level mixed wastes generated, treated, and stored on site.   For the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL), Dr. Abitz evaluated the waste characterization program for high-level radioactive and hazardous waste processed at the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant (ICPP).  Dr. Abitz also directed geochemical studies at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) that evaluated the composition and origin of saline groundwater and brine in the repository strata.\r\n\r\nEducation and Training\r\n\tB.A., Geology, Humboldt State University, Arcata, California; 1981\r\n\tM.S., Geology, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque; 1984\r\n\tPh.D., Geology, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque; 1989\r\nEnvironmental Risk Assessment Communication and Application Workshop, INEL Oversight Program, Boise, Idaho; 1992\r\n\tOSHA HAZWOP Training, 29 CFR 1910.120 (40 hours, IT Corporation, 1994)\r\n\r\n\r\nExperience and Background\r\n\r\n2006 - present\r\nPrincipal Geochemist/Owner, Geochemical Consulting Services, Blue Ash, Ohio\r\n\r\nTechnical Support to the Savannah River Site \r\n•       Dr. Abitz supported the contract transition team for Savannah River Nuclear Solutions (SRNS).  He reviewed RCRA and CERCLA groundwater remedial systems (electrical resistivity heating with soil vapor extraction, chemical reactive barrier, and tritium phytoremediation), project controls and management systems used to status the remediation work, and regulatory milestones to assess the status of the Area Closure Projects and SRNS readiness to perform the work scope.  He also supports SRNS in the preparation of the ARRA baseline estimate for the Solid Waste Management Project.   \r\n\r\nNESHAP Report for the Fernald Preserve, Cincinnati, Ohio \r\n•       For the Fernald Annual Sitewide Environmental Report, Dr. Abitz prepares the chapters on air emissions (particulate with uranium, thorium and radium isotopes, and radon), population dose, and the NESHAP annual report. \r\n\r\nGeochemical Expert for the Navajo & Sioux Nations and the  Goliad County Groundwater Conservation District\r\n•       Dr. Abitz provides legal testimony, technical review, geochemical modeling, and geological analysis for work associated with the proposed in situ uranium leach mines in the vicinity of Church Rock and Crownpoint, New Mexico and Goliad, Texas, and the expansion of the Crow Butte mine in Nebraska. \r\n\r\nRisk Assessment for the Fernald Closure Project (FCP), Cincinnati, Ohio\r\n•       Tasked with the responsibility to develop and author the Interim Residual Risk Assessment for the Fernald site, Dr. Abitz evaluated the risk to visitors and workers exposed to residual contaminants in air, soil and surface-water pathways.  Risk scenarios showed the incremental lifetime cancer risk to the receptors was below the recommended EPA maximum of 0.0001.          \r\n2003 – 2006\r\nManager of the Environmental Services Group and Senior Consultant, Fluor Fernald, Inc., Cincinnati Ohio\r\n\r\n•       As the manager for the Environmental Services Group (ESG), Dr. Abitz oversaw the work of over 50 scientists and technicians.  Personnel in the ESG performed water, soil and air sampling and monitoring; analytical services for radionuclides, metals and organic compounds; data verification, validation, reduction and reporting; and  in situ soil activity measurements for 226Ra, 232Th, and 238U via the site’s real-time instrument measurement program (RTIMP).  \r\n\r\n•       As the site geochemist, he prepared an estimate of the curie inventory for the OSDF to provide a baseline value to DOE legacy management.  The scope of this task was to develop the estimate using information from the Ohio Field Office Recycled Uranium Project Report, OU3 and OU5 RI/FS documents, the Fernald Dosimetry Reconstruction Project, remedial operation records, historic records, active monitoring data, interviews with technical personnel who supervised plant operations from the early 1960’s through production shut down in 1989, and analytical results on soil placed in the OSDF.\r\n\r\n•       Dr. Abitz also served as senior consultant to the FCP on the long-term remediation strategy for the Great Miami aquifer.  In this capacity, he coordinated laboratory and microscopy studies on the form of uranium present on aquifer sediments.  The laboratory and microscopy studies examined the amount of uranium that is fixed to the sediments via chemical adsorption and overgrowth rims versus the mobile fraction that is readily desorbed from the aquifer matrix.  These key studies identified and addressed the kinetics of uranium reactions to determine the time constraints associated with achieving the EPA’s drinking water standard for uranium. \r\n1998 - 2003\r\nEnvironmental Science Manager/Project Manager/Senior Consultant, Fluor Fernald, Inc., Cincinnati, Ohio.\r\n\r\n•       In his role as environmental science manager, Dr. Abitz directed the RTIMP, which provided in situ soil activity measurements for 226Ra, 232Th, and 238U in live time.  This program supports excavation and D&D work by scanning soil to confirm U contamination is below the waste acceptance criteria for Fernald’s on-site disposal facility (OSDF). Prior to the release of remediated land, the RTIMP performs in situ activity measurements to demonstrate that the soil is below the final remediation levels established for 226Ra, 232Th, and 238U.\r\n\r\n•       As a project manager, Dr. Abitz managed a remediation budget of six million dollars for Title I/II design work for D&D of structures and removal of all contaminated soil and subgrade structures within the former Production Area.  Dr. Abitz lead a team of engineers and scientists who integrated the remedial design with regulatory issues, sampling and analysis plans, waste management operations, demolition and construction activities, health and safety issues, radiological controls, and quality assurance protocols.\r\n\r\n•       Dr. Abitz served as a senior consultant to the DOE Technology Development Program, where he performed technical oversight of several university studies dealing with the mobilization of uranium and its removal from groundwater.  He was active with laboratory investigations that examine the distribution of uranium phases in soil and aquifer sediment, the leaching behavior of the uranium phases, the treatment of contaminated soil with phosphate, and the geochemical properties of aggregate materials used to construct liners in the OSDF.  The research established important baseline information on the distribution of uranium in the aquifer and in OSDF construction materials, while treatment studies evaluated the effectiveness of phosphate in reducing the solubility and mobility of uranium in the disposal cell.\r\n\r\n•       As a participant in research that evaluated the natural attenuation of uranium using a combination of passive inorganic and organic systems, Dr. Abitz was involved with work groups from industry, academia and DOE laboratories.  The inorganic systems that were investigated include rip-rap channels constructed with rock containing iron oxyhydroxide phases (e.g., goethite and hematite) or phosphate minerals (e.g., apatite) and flow-through cells using zero-valent iron.  Organic systems that showed potential promise include sulfate-reducing bacteria, microbial mats, lichen, and phytoextraction.  A combination of these systems may prove to be practical and cost effective in the treatment of low leachate volumes generated by the OSDF after its closure.\r\n1997 -1998\r\nPresident/Owner, Geochemical Consulting Services, Albuquerque, New Mexico. \r\nDr. Abitz served as a geochemical consultant to the Fernald Environmental Management Program (FEMP) and the WIPP Project.  \r\n\r\n•       Dr. Abitz performed confidential work for the Navajo Nation on the proposed in situ uranium leach mines in the vicinity of Church Rock and Crownpoint, New Mexico. \r\n\r\n•       At FEMP, he evaluated the efficiency of selected alternatives for soil and groundwater remediation, including soil washing and in situ uranium leaching methods.  This effort involved supervising the technical team, assisting in the negotiation of clean-up levels with DOE and EPA, developing soil-treatment protocols, and interacting with public-interest groups.  \r\n\r\n•\tAt the WIPP site, Dr. Abitz provided the operating contractor with expertise in the area of brine geochemistry.  He was responsible for oversight of laboratory analyses and QA/QC, data analysis, and geochemical interpretation of the composition and origin of fluids in the vicinity of underground operations.  Dr. Abitz also evaluated the solubility of transuranic elements in sodium-chloride brine and in brine containing organic-complexing agents such as citric acid, oxalic acid, and EDTA.\r\n1994 -1997\r\nProject Manager/Senior Staff Consultant, IT Corporation, Albuquerque, New Mexico.  Dr. Abitz served as project scientist/manager on geochemical tasks associated with the WIPP Project, Norton AFB Groundwater Study, FEMP Operable Units 5 and 3 RI/FS, and Navajo EPA.  Specific activities include:\r\n\r\n•      Conducted a rerun of the chemical compatibility analysis of TRU waste forms and container materials for Appendix C1 of the WIPP RCRA Part B permit. The chemical compatibility analysis was carried out with all defense generated, contact-handled (CH) and remote-handled (RH) transuranic-mixed waste streams  reported in the 1995 WIPP Transuranic Waste Baseline Inventory Report (WTWBIR).  Chemicals reported by the generator sites were classified into reaction groups as defined by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) document "A Method for Determining the Compatibility of Hazardous Wastes."  The list of potential chemical incompatibilities reported by the program was hand checked using the EPA document as a reference to assure proper functioning of the program.  All potential chemical incompatibilities were then evaluated on a case-by-case basis to identify which of the reactions could occur, given the nature of the waste, its chemical constituents, and final waste form.\r\n\r\n•\tAssisted in evaluating the geochemical performance of backfill configurations proposed in the WIPP Compliance Certification Application.  Modeled the interaction of Salado Formation brine with MgO placed in the backfill to estimate the quantity of MgO required to buffer the pH of the indigenous brine between 8 and 9.  This pH range is desirable for minimizing the solubility of plutonium and neptunium contained within the waste forms, and lowers the solubility of uranium and americium relative to lower pH values found in Salado Formation brine.\r\n\r\n•\tProject scientist responsible for developing the background groundwater report for Norton AFB  This report established background radionuclide concentrations in local and regional groundwater and provided a robust scientific model to explain the presence of elevated levels of naturally-occurring uranium.  The task required coordination of scientific and support staff to produce a principal milestone document that was delivered to the client one week ahead of schedule.\r\n\r\n•\tProject manager and scientist on the FEMP OU5 FS task to evaluate aqueous reactions of metal and radionuclide complexes in proposed injection zones of the Great Miami Aquifer.  Responsible for oversight of technical tasks, budget, schedule, and final technical report.  \r\n\r\n•\tProject scientist tasked with supporting the Navajo EPA on the evaluation of groundwater contamination from the mill tailings at the UNC Church Rock, New Mexico site.  Radionuclide, sulfate and nitrate concentrations were evaluated to discriminate between contamination originating from the mill tailings and natural salts present in the valley alluvium. \r\n\r\n•\tProject manager and scientist on the FEMP OU3 RI/FS task to evaluate the release of radionuclides and metals from the proposed on-site disposal facility. Responsible for oversight of technical tasks, budget, schedule, and final technical report.  \r\n1989 -1994\r\nSenior Geochemist, IT Corporation, Albuquerque, New Mexico  Dr. Abitz evaluated the radiochemistry of transuranic elements in sodium-chloride brine for the WIPP Project and served as the project geochemist for four operable units on the FEMP RI/FS.  He was also active setting up the LANL RMMA concept and provided radiochemistry support to INEL in developing a No Migration Variance Petition (NMVP) for the INEL calcine facility.\r\n\r\n•\tDeveloped solubility database for the WIPP EATF.  Evaluated the solubility of thorium, uranium, neptunium, plutonium, and americium in sodium-chloride brine and in the presence of organic complexing agents, such as EDTA and citric acid.  Prepared solubility charts of the radionuclides over the pH range of 2 to 12.\r\n\r\n•\tAuthored white paper on geochemistry of FEMP site for OU 5 RI/FS.  This paper discusses leaching, dissolution, and desorption processes that release uranium and its progeny from surface sources, adsorption and aqueous complexation of the solubilized uranium and progeny with subsurface soils and groundwater, and predicts secondary uranium phases that may form in the soils.\r\n\r\n•\tConducted site-surveys and interviewed LANL personnel on radiation practices associated with the handling, packaging, labeling, storage, transport, and disposal of transuranic materials.  Information was used to develop LANL RMMA concept, where each RMMA is held accountable for all radiaoactive materials that enter and exit the area.  \r\n\r\n•\tDeveloped waste analysis plans for transuranic and low-level mixed wastes present at LANL.  This activity was conducted to complete RCRA Part B permits and ensure regulatory compliance to DOE orders for all LANL facilities that generate, store, or dispose of mixed waste.\r\n\r\n•\tManaged and had technical oversight on geochemical program associated with FEMP RI/FS.  Program tasks include the characterization of soil mineralogy by polarized light microscopy and x-ray diffraction studies, design and implementation of laboratory tests to characterize the composition of leachate derived from cemented and vitrified waste samples, evaluation of contaminant adsorption ratios, data validation, and tracking of labor and material costs. \r\n\r\n•\tDesigned laboratory experiments for FEMP RI/FS to measure adsorption ratios of radionuclides and metals and implemented ANSI/ANS-16.1 leach tests to evaluate the performance of cemented waste forms.  Results were used to evaluate the most effective alternative for immobilizing radionuclides and metals from a near surface disposal cell.\r\n\r\n\r\n•\tLed INEL waste characterization program on calcined solid waste.  Responsible for evaluating radiochemistry data on uranium fission products and transuranic elements in aqueous and calcined waste forms.  Provided assistance in the development of EPA approved sampling and analytical plans to support a draft no migration variance petition for the radioactive calcined waste stored at the ICPP.  \r\nProfessional Affiliations\r\n\tGeological Society of America\r\n\tInternational Association of Geochemistry and Cosmochemistry\r\n\r\nPublications              \r\n\tAbitz, R.J., 2008, The Need for Valid Statistical Protocols to Establish Baseline Groundwater Quality at Uranium ISL Mines, Geological Society of America Abstracts w/Programs, Vol. 40.\r\n\r\n\tAbitz, R., R.

Specifically, our research is aimed at developing rapid biological sample preparation techniques suitable for proteomic measurements that can be implemented in field-portable instrumentation. These techniques are based on the use of non-enzymatic steps to lyse/digest biological samples to a stage that is suitable for MS analysis. Our laboratory pioneered the use of microwave heating for non-enzymatic digestion of proteins at aspartic acid and disulfide bonds and other non-enzymatic site-specific techniques that reduce digestion times from hours to seconds.\r\n\r\nResearch conducted by the Basile Group also focuses on alternative energy sources like methane production from bacteria residing in coal-bed deposits. Research in this area is geared at performing broad spectrum analysis of soluble matter in coal sludge and proteomic analysis of methanogenic bacteria.	2015-02-27 05:24:57.684112	2015-02-27 05:24:57.684112	431

He has over 20 years of experience focused on the evaluation of contaminant fate and transport in groundwater and the vadose zone.\r\n\r\nPractice Specialties\r\nMr. McAlary specializes in assessing and mitigating the migration of volatile organic compound (VOC) vapors from the sub-surface into buildings and the associated human health risks. He coauthored the first technical publication demonstrating the potential for enhanced groundwater contamination attributable to vapor diffusion in 1989. He conducted his first assessment of subsurface vapor intrusion to indoor air in 1992 and since has conducted site-specific assessments of vapor intrusion at dozens of sites across the United States and internationally. Mr. McAlary has been the Technical Director of one of the world’s largest studies of subsurface vapor intrusion since 1997 at a site in the United Kingdom. He was invited by the U.S. EPA to participate in the development of the RCRA Supplemental Environmental Indicator (EI) Guidance on vapor intrusion, and was one of the three primary co-authors. He has provided technical consultation in support of litigation involving several vapor intrusion issues. He also has served as a technical specialist in regulatory negotiations involving groundwater contamination and vapor intrusion issues where his expertise and communication skills have been critical to stakeholder understanding of the complex nature of the topics.\r\n\r\nAdvancing the State-of-the-Practice\r\nHe continues to advance the state-of-the-practice by serving as a member of the U.S. EPA Expert Panel charged with revising the 2002 Draft OSWER Vapor Intrusion Guidance, teaching short courses on vapor intrusion at conferences and workshops and conducting applied research at several test-sites.

Pennell is an Assistant Professor (Research) of Engineering at Brown University. In addition, Pennell is the State Agencies Liaison for the Superfund Basic Research Program at Brown University. She received her PhD in Civil Engineering from Purdue University. Prior to obtaining her PhD, she worked for five years as an environmental consultant designing and implementing remediation systems at numerous industrial and commercial properties. Currently her research interests involve a range of environmentally relevant topics including: the fate and transport of organic compounds; water disinfection processes; and innovative treatment techniques for recalcitrant compounds.\r\n\r\nPennell's research is focused on two main environmental areas: vapor intrusion and water disinfection. Vapor intrusion involves the migration of volatile (and in some cases semi-volatile) contaminants present in the subsurface into aboveground structures. The fate and transport processes that govern vapor intrusion are similar to conventional groundwater fate and transport processes. However, vapor intrusion is complicated by the fact that it occurs in the unsaturated zone, where vapor, aqueous (i.e. soil moisture) and non-aqueous phase transport must be considered.\r\n\r\nPrior to joining Brown University, Pennell's research focused on developing a water disinfection processes. She has published on the use of two disinfections used in combination to achieve disinfection of potable water under the severe constraints imposed by long-term space travel. She continues to be active in research relating to water disinfection applications.\r\n\r\nSelected Publications:\r\n\r\nBozkurt, O., Pennell, K. G., Suuberg, E. M.

I am particularly interested in addressing the double jeopardy faced by communities of color and the poor who experience high exposures to environmental hazards and who are more vulnerable to the toxic effects of pollution due to poverty, malnutrition, discrimination, and underlying health conditions. How do matters of race and class affect distributions of health risks in the United States? What are the causes and consequences of environmental disparities and health inequalities? How can research create "upstream" opportunities for intervention and prevention? I am also interested in evaluating the influence of community participation on environmental health research, science, regulation, and policy-making, as well as in developing methods to foster community-based participatory research.\r\n\r\nCurrent Projects\r\nUnderstanding & Addressing Cumulative Impacts on California Communities\r\nThis project develops scientifically valid and publicly transparent analytical methods to identify disparities in environmental hazard exposures and health status for key population groups identified by race/ethnicity, socio-economic status, and other vulnerability indicators to inform regulatory decision-making and environmental policy.\r\n\t  \t \r\nEnvironmental Justice & Climate Change\r\nThis project convenes advocates and researchers to assess the disparate impact of climate change on communities of color and the poor with a focus on the following issues: (1) health and economic impacts of extreme weather events; (2) environmental justice and social equity implications of proposed greenhouse gas reduction strategies in California associated with the AB32 Scoping Plan; and (3) disparities in community capacity to adapt to environmental impacts of climate change.\r\n\t  \t \r\nBuilding a Regional Voice for Environmental Health & Justice in Southern CA\r\nThis community-academic collaboration combines economic and environmental health research, policy advocacy, and public education and organizing to improve environmental health in low-income communities of color in Southern California.\r\n\t  \t \r\nIntegrating Measures of Cumulative Impact and Community-Level Vulnerability\r\nThis project studies the relationship between adverse birth outcomes and traffic density in California and how individual and neighborhood-level measures of vulnerability may amplify the toxic impacts of pollution exposures.\r\n\t  \t \r\nMerging Breast Cancer and Environmental Justice\r\nThis project examines issues of environmental justice through a study of household exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals linked to breast cancer in Richmond and Bolinas, California.\r\n\t  \t \r\nAir Pollution and Environmental Justice\r\nThis project has several goals: (1) to examine from the perspective of environmental equity the impacts of industrial, commercial, and transportation land use on specific neighborhoods; (2) to develop indicators of the cumulative impact of exposures and the relative vulnerability of various communities that can be used in regulatory decision-making and enforcement; and (3) to address data needs identified in the Cal/EPA EJ Advisory Committee Recommendations Report.\r\n\t  \t \r\nDisaster, Resilience, and the Built Environment on the Gulf Coast\r\nThis interdisciplinary project examines the resilience of the ecological and built environments in Gulf Coast communities, both urban and rural, that endure chronic wind and water damage from hurricanes. 	2015-02-27 05:25:00.19167	2015-02-27 05:25:00.19167	453

He has a long history of working with a variety of environmental and natural resource statutes, regulations, and programs.  He currently serves as Vice President of Sustainability Programs for Plexus Leadership Innovations, a subsidiary of Plexus Scientific Corporation.\r\n\r\nSummary of Capabilities\r\n?\tFacilitation – Creates environments where legitimate stakeholders make their own best decisions.  Professional structure and guidance of meetings, workshops, conferences and stakeholder dialogue\r\n?\tConflict Analysis – Assessments of the political, economic and/or environmental context for business, policy, and strategy.\r\n?\tPublic Involvement Process Design – Plans and structures means and methods for robust and constructive community engagement.\r\n?\tPolicy Development and Analysis – Works with Federal, state, and local government to develop innovative policies and programs that achieve stated goals.\r\n?\tStrategic Planning – Aligns vision, mission, goals, objectives and performance metrics through the use of group dynamics, organizational understandings and technology.\r\n?\tSustainability Assessment – Evaluates the opportunities for simultaneously achieving economic, environmental, and social goals and objectives.\r\n\r\n \r\nProfessional Experience\r\nBefore joining Plexus, Mr. Saslow was a Special Assistant with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the President and CEO of Consensus Solutions, Inc., and a Senior Principal with the NewFields Companies.

The Agency is rumored to be planning on denying a permit for surface mining at Spruce No. 1 in Logan County, WV in the Spruce Fork Watershed, an area highly impacted by previous mining activities. The public hearing took place on May 18 in Charleston, WV.\r\n\r\nThe Spruce No. 1 Mine is one of the largest surface mining operations ever authorized in Appalachia.  The Mingo Logan Coal Company has already been authorized by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Huntington District (Corps) to construct six “valley fills” and numerous sedimentation ponds in Seng Camp Branch, Pigeonroost Branch and Oldhouse Branch and certain tributaries to those waters by discharging excess spoil generated by surface coal mining operations.  These on-site streams are tributaries of and exhibit surface water connections to Spruce Fork of the Little Coal River, which ultimately flows into the Coal River.\r\n\r\nEPA has reason to believe that the Spruce No. 1 Mine, as currently authorized, could result in unacceptable adverse effects to fish and wildlife resources.  EPA has issued a public notice of a proposed determination to restrict or prohibit the discharge of fill material at the Spruce No. 1 Mine project site consistent with their authority under Section 404(c) of the Clean Water Act.  EPA is concerned that the project could result in unacceptable adverse effects on the aquatic ecosystem, particularly to fish and wildlife resources and water quality.  EPA is also concerned that the project may have cumulative adverse impacts.  EPA believes that the Spruce No. 1 project, in conjunction with numerous other mining operations either under construction or proposed for the Coal River sub-basin, may contribute to the cumulative loss of water quality, aquatic and forest resources. The Coal River sub-basin is already heavily mined and demonstrates impacts associated with surface coal mining.\r\n\r\nMr. Saslow, Nora Chiong and Dan Gerszewski designed the process for registration and the deliverance of public testimony at this hearing.  Mr. Saslow moderated/facilitated the speakers throughout.  Over 800 people attended the scheduled five hour hearing – and over 125 people spoke.  Security levels were high with over 75 uniformed and plain clothes offers in attendance.  The hearing went off without a hitch.  Mr. Saslow and his staff received high compliments from the US EPA Regional Administrator from Philadelphia and others.\r\n\r\nStates’ Association for Natural Resources (SANR), National Locations\r\nOctober, 2008 to Present – Outsourced Executive Director\r\nResponsible for all operations, logistics, and facilitation and for the conveyance of member opinions to national and regional policy makers.  SANR is a Cabinet-level voice for natural resource management and sustainability, as regional and national policy evolves in the following areas:\r\n?\tLand valuation and carbon sequestration as it relates to climate change\r\n?\tClimate change resilience strategies – adaptation\r\n?\tFederal spending and its impact on natural resource agencies\r\n?\tPolicy on renewable energy opportunities on public lands (particularly state lands) and the connection to opportunities on Federal lands\r\n?\tChildren in nature\r\nStrategic Planning, Hawai`i DLNR, Honolulu, HI\r\nMay, 2007 to June, 2008 -- Senior Facilitator\r\nCompleted a strategic planning project for the Natural Area Reserves System (NARS) in Hawaii’s Department of Land and Natural Resources.

(Employed by Consensus Solutions, Incorporated during this effort)\r\n\r\nSorting Tools Dialogue, Multistate Working Group, White Plains, NY\r\nJanuary, 2005 to September, 2005 -- Senior Facilitator \r\nDesigned a dialogue that launched a discussion on how to construct an understandable and effective sorting process—for policy, regulatory, and management purposes—that recognizes the full range of innovative tools and allows organizations and individuals to better determine which tool or tools are most apt in a particular set of circumstances.  These tools range from traditional enforcement mechanisms, compliance assistance programs, auditing, and environmental management systems to corporate social responsibility mechanisms, insurance considerations, public reporting, public access to data, and many others.  It was considered imperative to use a broad range of tools in fashioning tailor-made responses to specific risks to solve environmental problems.  The MSWG noted that the tools are not an end in and of themselves and that a problem-solving approach (to environmental issues) selects the most important tasks and then the appropriate tools in each case, rather than deciding on the important tools and selecting the tasks to fit.  The tools were deemed to be part of a strategy designed to maximize environmental outcomes.  (Employed by Consensus Solutions, Incorporated during this effort)\r\n\r\nSustainability Assessment, WV DEP, Throughout West Virginia\r\nApril, 2004 to November, 2004 -- Senior Facilitator \r\nHelped the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection to develop a Sustainability Assessment.  Sustainable Development is a broad concept that addresses the way in which activities impact the economy, the environment, and social well-being.  While it is generally accepted that development should be sustainable in all three of these dimensions, practical application of the concept is both complex and challenging.  During the course of this project, more than 150 leaders from in and around West Virginia were contacted, many of whom spent a significant amount of time contributing to the contents of this assessment.  Although their understanding of sustainability greatly varied, all presented valued perspectives.  Commonly, several “drivers and barriers” were consistently referenced factors across the many interviews—among them, the “mountaineer” culture that pervades cities and suburbs.  These were the most important factors in the development of a “Road Map for Sustainability.”  (Employed by Consensus Solutions, Incorporated during this effort)\r\n\r\nVirginia CAN, VA DEQ (throughout Virginia)\r\nMarch, 2004 to June, 2004 -- Senior Facilitator \r\nServed Virginia’s Department of Environmental Quality as it worked to establish the Virginia Comprehensive Assistance Network (VA CAN).

He earned tenure at ISU in 2008.  He came here following 10 years at the University of West Florida where he was a tenured Associate professor. He received his undergraduate degree in 1978 in Biology from Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA. \r\nHe received his Masters degree in Microbiology and Biochemistry from the Unversity of Idaho, Moscow, ID in 1980, where he worked on fungal metabolite identification of an antifungal compound produce by a soil Penicillium urticae in the laboratory of Dr. Al Lingg.  He received his Ph.D. in Bacterial Genetics and Physiology in 1985 from the Department of Microbiology of the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN.  Here he studied under Dr. Gary Sayler elucidating bacterial biodegradative pathways and genetics of bacterial polychlorinated biphenyl metabolism.  After coming to Idaho State University, Dr. Shields began a collaboration with Drs. Peter Sheridan, Cathy Spiegel and Larry Farrell to examine the genetics and physiology of bacterial toxins as they pertain to human health.  This quickly led to an interest in Clinical Laboratory Sciences in which Dr. Shields has now taught since 2007.  In order obtain his MLS certification, Dr. Shields completed the CLS program here at ISU, earning a second bachelors degree in the process.\r\n\r\nTeaching areas: Genetics, Microbiology, Molecular Biology Laboratory Techniques, Environmental Biotechnology and Medical Molecular Diagnostics.\r\n\r\nPublications (Indicates *undergraduate or **graduate student coauthors)\r\n\r\nEffects of electrode surface area on electricity generation in an air-cathode single chamber microbial fuel cell fed with potato processing wastewater.

Much of our work focuses on two such agents, vitamin A and alcohol. These are not as disparate as they might seem; alcoholics are frequently vitamin A deficient, and both vitamin A and alcohol are metabolized by the same enzymes, creating opportunities for cross-talk. Periodically, we investigate environmental toxins, such as dioxin and trichloroethylene. Our overall goal is to identify maternal intakes of these agents that affect the risk for birth defects in her children.\r\n\r\nRepresentative Publications\r\n\r\nDrake VJ, Koprowski SL, Hu N, Lough JW, Smith SM. 2006.

Feigley, PhD, CIH, is a Professor in the USC Department of Environmental Health Sciences, and is a Co-Principal Investigator of the USC-CPHP grant. He has over 30 years' experience in the areas of air pollution, industrial hygiene and exposure assessment. He is Director of the NIOSH-sponsored, ABET-accredited industrial hygiene training program at USC. He teaches classes in industrial ventilation, air pollution, evaluation of occupational environments, and aerosol science. In his early research, he led experimental studies of: evaporative emissions from painted surfaces, diffusive sampling devices, the permeation of polymeric materials used for chemical protective clothing, and the filtration of air for air cleaning and air contaminant sampling. Dr. Feigley has been Principal Investigator on several collaborative projects on human exposure assessment and environmental epidemiology including investigations of the health effects of hazardous waste incinerator emissions, and the impact of trichlorethylene exposure in children. His other research includes funded studies on chemical markers of airborne bacteria in schools, and improvement of occupational exposure estimation through investigations of the fundamental determinants of workroom exposure.\r\n\r\nDr. Feigley served on the NIOSH Study Section (for review of research grant applications). He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) Committee on Toxicology (COT) for three terms of three years each. In conjunction with his work on the Committee, he has participated in: the development of exposure limits for the international space station (NASA), the review of the Army Environmental Hygiene Agency's Toxicology Program, the development of guidelines for setting Community Emergency Exposure Levels for hazardous substances, and the establishment of U.S. Navy Permissible Exposure Levels for JP-5 and JP-8 jet fuels. Also, Dr. Feigley chaired a COT subcommittee assessing risks from hazardous waste incinerator emissions to personnel at a Naval Air Station in Atsugi, Japan. He is currently a member of the NAS committee to review the Office of Management and Budget's Risk Assessment Bulletin.\r\n\r\nDr. Feigley co-led a network of CPHPs that produced the "Occupational Safety and Worker Preparedness Exemplar." The group developed a "Chemical/Radiation Preparedness Resource Kit" which was completed in October 2007.\r\n\r\nSelected Publications:\r\n\r\nBusbin, D., C.E. Feigley, D.W. Underhill, and D.

Human exposure to metals occurs via a number of different scenarios that include exposure in the workplace; in the home, such as lead paint, or arsenic in drinking water, or outdoors; due to airborne emissions from industry or transportation vehicles. In the past, Dr. Graziano’s research was almost entirely devoted to lead poisoning, which has contributed to understanding the adverse effects of lead exposure on childhood development. As a pharmacologist, his laboratory developed the oral drug that is now used to treat children with lead poisoning. More recently, Dr. Graziano’s work has taken him to Bangladesh, where his current research is aimed at understanding the consequences of arsenic exposure on the Bangladeshi population, and on devising strategies to reduce toxicity and provide arsenic-free drinking water, a problem that spans beyond the political borders of Bangladesh, to much of South Asia, from India to Vietnam. Recent findings that both arsenic and manganese, both elevated in Bangladesh drinking water, are associated with cognitive deficits in children, add urgency to solving this enormous public health and environmental problem.\r\n\r\nRESEARCH:\r\nAreas of interest include: a new drug for childhood lead poisoning; environmental lead, arsenic and manganese exposure, pregnancy outcome and infant development; metal metabolism and neurodegenerative diseases.\r\n\r\nSelected Publications:\r\n1.

These include investigations to determine incidence rates of basal cell and squamous cell skin cancer for a geographically defined US population, and to assess the extent of any increase over the past 20 years. Another aspect of this research is a case-control study of these malignancies to identify risks associated with emerging exposures such as tanning lamps, ingestion of arsenic-containing drinking water, immunosuppressive therapies and other factors. This research has been extended to study the effects of arsenic on bladder cancer and to conduct chemical analyses of household drinking water supplies.\r\n\r\nMost recently, Professor Karagas' major research initiative involves establishing a cohort of pregnant women in New Hampshire to assess the potential impact of arsenic and other exposures on risk of maternal and infant infection and birth outcomes. She is currently the Director of the Children's Environmental Health and Disease Prevention Center at Dartmouth. Her ongoing work further includes studies of melanoma in women and collaborative investigations of exposure biomarkers, individual susceptibility, and biological response to environmental agents.\r\n\r\n\r\nPublications:\r\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?cmd=PureSearch&db=pubmed&term=Karagas%20M[author]\r\n	2015-02-27 05:25:02.373501	2015-02-27 05:25:02.373501	476

Crump\r\n\r\nExpertise:\r\n\r\nDr. Crump has over 25 years of experience in assessing risk from exposure to toxic materials. Statistical models for assessing risk developed by Dr. Crump have been widely used by regulatory agencies and private groups. He has served on science advisory boards of the USEPA, the National Center for Toxicological Research, the Mickey Leland National Urban Air Toxics Research Center, and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, as well as several committees of the National Academy of Sciences that addressed risk assessment issues. He has experience in assessing risk from exposure to many toxic substances, including asbestos and dioxin. He recently coauthored a document for the USEPA that proposed an improved method for assessing risk from exposure to asbestos. He served on the Royal Society of Canada Expert Panel on Asbestos. He was a member of the USEPA Science Advisory Board Dioxin Reassessment Review Committee on two occasions, and was an advisor to the FAO/WHO Committee on Food Additives that assessed risk from dioxin in food.\r\n\r\nExperience:\r\n    * Directed statistical reanalysis of data from animal bioassays of asbestos to determine the relative potency of asbestos structures of various sizes (length and width), types (fiber, bundle, cluster matrix) and compositions (chrysotile and amphibole).\r\n    * Conducted worst-case analysis of health effects from exposure to TCDD released during a train accident.\r\n    * Developed statistical method for analyzing animal carcinogenicity data that accounts appropriately for tumors at multiple sites.\r\n    * Developed statistical method for estimating the number of false hypothesis among a large number of hypothesis tests and applied this method to estimate the number of carcinogens and anti-carcinogens among 400 chemicals studied by the National Toxicology Program.\r\n    * Assessed the risk from asbestos exposure to children in school buildings.\r\n    * Developed risk assessments for occupational exposure to numerous substances, including asbestos, benzene, and arsenic.\r\n    * Developed the "linearized multistage" approach to assessing carcinogenic risk from low exposures.\r\n    * Directed review of risk assessment approaches used by USEPA and made recommendations regarding these approaches.\r\n    * Developed the "benchmark method" used by regulatory agencies as a replacement for the NOAEL in safety assessment.\r\n    * Conducted benchmark analyses from epidemiological data on arsenic and mercury.\r\n\r\nEducation:\r\n\r\nPh.D., Mathematics, Montana State University; M.A., Mathematics, University of Denver; B.S., Electrical Engineering, Louisiana Tech University\r\n\r\nPractice Areas\r\n\r\nHealth Sciences: Applied Epidemiology\r\nHealth Sciences: Risk Assessment & Risk Management	2015-02-27 05:25:02.821877	2015-02-27 05:25:02.821877	481

Dr. Datta’s research involves the study of interactions between plant, soil, microbial and water systems to understand the mechanisms of uptake and detoxification of specific environmental contaminants in biota from two broad angles – biochemistry and genetics.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, Dr. Datta’s current research focus is on the study of bioavailability of metal contaminants in aquatic media and the potential of using plants to remediate metal-contaminated sites, mediated by microbes. Dr. Datta actively collaborates with environmental geochemists, soil scientists, and analytical chemists from Harvard School of Public Health, Montclair State University, and University of Texas at San Antonio. Dr. Datta also works on the bioavailability of contaminants using in-vitro and in-vivo models. She has also been working on the remediation of TNT, petroleum hydrocarbons, perchlorate and chromate in soil and water and in developing “green technology” as part of an environmental R&D, SIROM Scientific Solutions, LLC based in Montclair, New Jersey. Combining field, greenhouse, and laboratory data, she investigates the mechanisms of contaminant bioavailability, availability to plants, the kinetics of metal uptake in plants under various conditions and studies the molecular mechanisms of contaminant uptake and detoxification by accumulator and other high biomass plants, including crop plants. She also works on health effects of metals (arsenic and lead) in human cell culture and animal systems in collaboration with biomedical faculty at the UT Health Science Center at San Antonio. Her research is strongly related to student experiential learning. So far, she has graduated 2 PhD students, 5 MS students, and supervised 4 post-doctoral fellows.\r\n\r\nCURRENT PUBLICATIONS:\r\n\r\n    * Datta R and Chourey PS (2001) Sugar-regulated control of a-tubulin in maize cell-suspension culture.

I have focused on the actions of environmental agents on disruption of cellular signaling processes. We investigate the modulation of cellular signaling pathways by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD, or Dioxin). Dioxin action is mediated by a specific intracellular receptor, called the Ah receptor. We have been studying the mechanism by which dioxins via the Ah receptor communicate with other intracellular receptors; particularly the retinoic acid- and the estrogen receptors in vitro using cultivated human keratinocytes and human endometrial cells. This research is important in understanding environmental endocrine disruption and human health. We are also studying the developmental actions of dioxins in vivo using zebrafish as a model system for environmental effects on development. Current interests are in the area of Systems Biology and how this emerging field can be applied to human health risk assessment.\r\n\r\nRecent Publications:\r\n\r\nToscano, W. A., Oehlke, K.

My interests are to develop tools, through applied research, for regulators as well as risk assessment professionals, to achieve these goals.\r\n\r\n    * Development of passive sampling devices that integrate concentrations of contaminants in the aquatic environment over time. This includes the semipermeable membrane device (SPMD) as well as other artificial substrates such as low-density polyethylene strips, or solvent / sorbent-filled membranes.\r\n    * Integration of human and ecological risk assessment. Often there is a large duplication of effort when assessing risk for human and ecological receptors. By examining current paradigms we can improve and streamline the processes and better protect human health and the environment.\r\n\r\nSelected Publications:\r\n\r\n    * Hofelt, C. and D.

At Ecology, Lon worked on implementation of the Washington Superfund regulation (i.e. the Model Toxics Control Act), air data management and toxics issues, evaluation of seafood consumption rates for risk analysis, proposed revisions of Washington’s sediment management standards, and risk analysis for sediment toxic waste sites. Lon joined EPA Region 10’s Office of Environmental Assessment in 2001 where his main focus has been sediment Superfund site risk assessment. At EPA, Lon has focused on characterizing seafood consumption rates to assess risks for high seafood consuming groups including tribes and Asians/Pacific Islanders. He assisted Ecology in adopting a higher seafood consumption rate for Model Toxics Control Act sites in the Duwamish corridor and Elliott Bay based on data for Asians and Pacific Islanders. Most recently, he has collaborated with EPA’s Office of Research and Development, the Quinault Indian Nation, and the consulting firm Westat in developing a software package to assist tribes in conducting seafood consumption surveys. 	2015-02-27 05:25:04.095613	2015-02-27 05:25:04.095613	492

His research contributes greatly to the SRI's understanding of the chemistry of streams and groundwater in the Susquehanna watershed and he is a recognized expert on the chemistry of abandoned mine discharges throughout our region. He has helped local watershed groups remediate several mine discharges by designing passive treatment facilities. An avid fly fisherman, Carl also helped the local Buffalo Creek watershed association with a limestone-dosing facility to lessen the impact of acid rain on native brook trout habitat in headwater streams. Carl is currently studying the chemistry of frac and flow-back water associated with Marcellus Shale natural gas resources within the Susquehanna watershed. This effort is a significant contribution to environmental scientists and watershed groups in Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nEducation:\r\n\r\n    * Ph.D., Geology, 1993, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University\r\n    * M.

She brings over 30 years of broad industry experience to her consulting practice. Her work focuses on helping teams assess and recover from breakdowns, deal with inevitable conflict, make better, faster decisions – and accelerate their work.  Teams walk away with clarity about what they can do differently – both behaviorally and operationally – that will have meaningful impact on moving their product through the pipeline. \r\n\r\nShe works with US-based and global teams and their leaders. Regardless of whether they are a project team, a support team, a department, or a newly merged organization, they have one thing in common -- they need to work better together so that they can reach their goals faster and more effectively. \r\n\r\nExperienced in building a team-based infrastructure from the ground up, she also works with organizations who wish to build an environment that will support and nurture top team performance. She’s led the development of the requisite team structures, governance, roles and competencies needed by management, team leaders and team members. \r\n\r\nA published researcher, Ruth was co-leader of a study designed to identify specific behaviors and strategies of the highest performing teams within the pharmaceutical industry.  The study characterized drivers of top team performance, and was published in the Organization Development Journal, Summer 2007.\r\n\r\nWORKING APPROACH\r\n\r\nWhen you work with Ruth, you can expect to see desirable and sustainable changes in your team's performance and productivity. Results will come faster, with a lot less struggle and effort.\r\nShe is flexible, appreciating that your needs, concerns and priorities are different from those of her other clients.  One size does not fit all. \r\nShe believes job is to transfer skills, so that clients are better equipped to deal with problems the next time they surface. \r\nShe operates with the highest level of integrity, and tells it like she sees it. Delving into the inner workings of teams sometimes uncovers thorny issues.  She’ll discuss any potential obstacles that could impede success, and is committed to ensuring clients don’t waste valuable time on strategies that won’t deliver results. \r\n\r\n\r\nCAREER HISTORY \r\n2006 – present  Clarity Consulting, Inc., President \r\nAdjunct faculty member of the Graduate Center for Education and Training, Jefferson College of Graduate Studies, Thomas Jefferson University. \r\n\r\n2004        \tJohnson & Johnson - Centocor R&D, Director, R&D Organization Development \r\n2001               Johnson & Johnson - Centocor, R&D, Associate Director, Strategic Team Development\r\n1998\tJohnson & Johnson - Janssen Research, Assistant Director, JRF Training and Development\r\n1994\t\tJohnson & Johnson - Janssen Research Foundation, Sr. Manager, R&D Learning Support\t\r\n1973 – 1994   Johnson & Johnson – Various roles across J&J in the areas of research, drug development, and pharmacology of the central nervous system \r\n\r\nCAREER HIGHLIGHTS\r\n\r\n2006 – Present\tClarity Consulting, founder and principal\r\nRuth’s services and offerings continue to evolve, as each team, each leader and each organization present new and interesting challenges involving group work.  \r\n\r\nRecent client projects:\r\n\r\n•\tOvercoming barriers to communication\r\n•\tGetting a troubled project back on track\r\n•\tGaining faster start up of a priority project with a structured team launch\r\n•\tRemoving roadblocks that were threatening a partnership\r\n•\tMinimizing the run-in time for a new team leader\r\n•\tEliminating cross-purpose work that was slowing a team’s progress\r\n•\tRemoving organizational barriers to teamwork\r\n•\tEliminating ambiguity about a new department’s role in the organization \r\n\r\nShe’s designed several “off the shelf” programs intended for intact teams or departments:  \r\nTeam Building or Team Development – Intended for working teams, helpful for teams that are “stuck”, or are caught in a churn of inefficiency.

He has managed a wide variety of projects including remedial investigations/feasibility studies (RI/FS), remedial actions, environmental assessments of mining and other properties, negotiation and litigation support, removal oversight, community involvement, sampling/analyses of environmental media, records management, real property acquisition support, and integrated Phase I/II site assessments/ investigations.  Project management responsibilities include planning, scheduling, budgeting, personnel supervision, and report writing/editing.\r\n\r\nEXPERIENCE:\r\n\r\n1999-Present: Terranext, Phoenix, Arizona\r\nMr. Gordon provides senior project management on hydrogeologic, remediation, and Brownfield project sites contaminated with metals, PCBs, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). His responsibilities include development of site investigation/remediation strategies, preparation of work, sampling/analysis, quality assurance, and health and safety plans, management of subcontractors, estimation of project costs, hydrogeologic interpretation, and report issuance. \r\n\r\nBureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Site Characterization, Gallup NM\r\nMr. Gordon managed a site characterization of the Gamerco Warehouse site located near Gallup, NM.  Operations at the site included incineration of out-of-date/specification items and burial of drums, metal, products, and other waste.  Terranext performed the following scope of work:\r\n\r\n•\tPrepare work plan, and sampling and analysis plan\r\n•\tExcavate backhoe trenches at suspected waste areas and characterize waste\r\n•\tCharacterize/profile investigative-derived waste for off-site disposal\r\n•\tPerform sampling/analysis of excavated material, and native soils at base of trenches\r\n•\tPrepare report identifying recommended soil cleanup levels and presenting specific recommendations for site closure\r\n\r\nBIA LUST Site Characterization Projects, Arizona and Utah\r\nMr. Gordon managed a LUST site characterization in Poston, Arizona (Colorado River Indian Tribe) and an identical project in Fort Duchesne, Utah (Ute Indian Reservation).  The facilities are primarily maintenance/ construction yards.  A site reconnaissance, review of existing records, and interviews with BIA site personnel were first performed to identify historic operational, chemical use/storage, and waste disposal activities.  The results were presented in work plans.  \r\n\r\nSubsurface investigations using Geoprobe and hollow-stem auger drilling technology were performed.  Depending on the area being investigated, collected samples were analyzed for total petroleum hydrocarbons, purgeable aromatic compounds, and total lead.  In addition, based on past site agricultural use, samples from certain areas also were analyzed for chlorinated and/or organophosphorous pesticides, chlorinated herbicides, VOCs, and/or semi-VOCs.  Groundwater monitor wells were then installed/sampled.  Reports were prepared for review by BIA and EPA.  \r\n\r\nWest Van Buren Area State Superfund Site, Phoenix, Arizona\r\nProject manager for RI of 15 square mile area in west Phoenix with extensive groundwater contamination.

Ms. Cochrane is currently part of a team performing a Preliminary Assessment/Site Inspection (PA/SI) at three dams within the Willamette Valley Basin, Oregon, in accordance with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Guidance for Performing Preliminary Assessments under CERCLA (EPA, 1991) and with the EPA Guidance for Performing Site Inspections under CERCLA (EPA, 1992). The PA involves reviewing readily available information to describe potentially hazardous waste releases that occurred at these Projects throughout their history of operations, including during its construction in order to evaluate whether contamination might be present at each facility that may harm human health and the environment. Also included was a site visit with the Client to observe areas of concern, and a review of publicly available, reasonably ascertainable federal, state, and local government records (or databases) for the subject and surrounding properties in order to develop an opinion on the presence and extent of any contaminants at the Project and to develop a conceptual site model (CSM).\r\nMs. Cochrane aided in evaluating the presence of contamination as part of the Site Inspections.  Sampling will consist of collecting surface and subsurface soil samples and sediment samples.  Samples will be analyzed for a wide-variety of constituents because contaminant sources are unknown in many of the areas.\r\n\r\nEnvironmental regulatory compliance audits of Federal Facilities, General Services Administration.  Ms. Cochrane is currently part of a team performing on-site environmental regulatory compliance audits at GSA-owned Federal buildings in California and Nevada. These audits assess potential environmental liability in current and future use and operations at each facility with consideration to applicable federal, state, local regulations, and with the associated U.S. TEAM Guides and State Supplements. The project requires experience or familiarity with the following environmental media: air quality and Title V permitting, water programs, pesticides programs, solid waste, universal and hazardous wastes, above ground and underground storage tanks, hazardous substances and chemicals, and toxic substances including asbestos, PCBs, and lead based paint in facilities. Ms. Cochrane evaluates the effectiveness of active environmental management systems and assesses risks from regulated and unregulated materials and practices through research on facility background and compliance history, onsite inspections, personnel interviews, and evaluation of findings. Team findings are compiled into detailed technical reports including advice on improvements, for which Ms. Cochrane demonstrates experience in technical writing and technical editing. \r\n\r\nConceptual site model development in litigation support, Colville Confederated Tribes.  In 2013, Ms. Cochrane co-authored a memo developing a conseptual site model for contaminant release from soils in the Upper Columbia River ulands as part of litigation support for the CCT. Ms. Cochrane researched and authored a literature review on transport mechanisms of heavy metals in soils, providing scientific basis for assumed release of smelter-associated contaminants into the uplands environment via erosion and runoff into fluvial systems, leaching into groundwater, root uptake by vegetation, and resuspension by wind erosion into air. \r\n\r\nField crew supervisor and manager for soil condition assessment, Colville Confederated Tribes (CCT).   In 2013, Ms. Cochrane worked as a field crew supervisor and manager of field operations of three teams performing field data and soil sample collection at 450 sites on forested lands within the Colville Indian Reservation, in order to establish soil baseline conditions to assist in natural resource management. Ms. Cochrane researched and acquired survey instruments and supporting materials needed for assessment implementation, designed a quality assurance/quality control protocol to CCT standards and requirements, ensured all field work was completed to standard and field personnel remained safe and in good health, and performed database data entry and management. The position required proficiency in GPS data collection using top-quality Trimble equipment and software; determining soil parameters including soil temperature and texture, excavation and description of soil profile, identification of organics, and documentation of surface disturbances; soil sample collection methods  preventing cross-contamination and other sample invalidations; identification to genus of native vegetation and canopy cover, and to species of invasive vegetation; orienteering, navigation and operation of four wheel drive vehicles over very rough terrain; and working and living in the field in all conditions. When field data collection was completed, Ms. Cochrane performed Nitrogen-Phosphorus-Potassium lab analysis of soil samples as part of a two person team and executed all post-processing of lab and field data, including differential correction of GPS data and export to ESRI-compatible formats. All field and lab data was compiled into a database and GIS layer created by Ms. Cochrane, which she used to design and produce visualizations of correlations between variables and assessment results. Ms. Cochrane participated in writing a detailed report of the assessment, for which she researched and authored the project background, and described all methods and theory of the field operations, lab analysis, and post-processing of GPS data, including difficulties encountered. \r\n\r\nField data management for habitat restoration efforts, Great Basin Institute (GBI).  As a volunteer with the AmeriCorps in 2012, Ms. Cochrane was responsible for collecting and managing field data of a habitat restoration project west of Las Vegas, Nevada. She maintained daily logs of project progress, including photo documentation and area surveyed using GPS; ensured necessary caution was exercised where endangered species were identified; and delivered in-field  lectures on the geology of the project area to fulfill the education requirements of participants in AmeriCorps programs. Ms. Cochrane’s data was compiled by GBI senior staff for reports to the National Forest Service.\r\n\r\nFairhaven Shipyard as a point source for metal ion contamination of Bellingham Bay, Washington.  As part of a team in 2011, Ms. Cochrane developed and implemented a study of heavy metal contaminants in Bellingham Bay. She performed the field data collection, consisting of surface water samples taken at locations of various distance from the Fairhaven Shipyard, thought to be a possible point source of contamination. Ms. Cochrane assisted in lab analysis of the samples, in which laser-ablation inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy (Agilent 7500ce with a New Wave UP213 laser) was used to determine levels of arsenic, lead, copper, zinc, and mercury. In a detailed report, Ms. Cochrane and team compared these results to levels of metal contaminants averaged across random Puget Sound locations near Bellingham Bay, discovering that concentrations were no higher near the shipyard than are average for the area.\r\n\r\nGIS analysis and recommendation of locations for new facility.  Using ESRI GIS core programs in 2010, Ms. Cochrane produced a detailed report outlining possible locations for construction of a new facility, with detailed recommendations stating pros and cons of five location options based off of interpretations she developed from GIS data. The report packet included maps drawn by Ms. Cochrane to assist in visualization of the variables considered when determining possible locations.\r\n\r\nExamination of environmental risks and benefits of current aquaculture practices.  In 2011, Ms. Cochrane researched environmental impacts of current aquaculture practices, compiling findings in a report used to help students make educated decisions when purchasing seafood. She considered six studies into various aspects of aquaculture, and included data from three sea farms to describe the environmental risks and benefits related to human health, biodiversity including transgenic fish, sustainability and large pollutant production. The final report was made available to students of Western Washington University in Bellingham, Washington.\r\n\r\nSequence of epibiont colonization of Mercenaria mercenaria as evidenced by trace fossils.   In a study of trace fossils on an edible, hard-shelled species of mollusk in 2011, Ms. Cochrane identified possible causes of death and developed a sequence of colonization of the fossil by epibiont organisms. The study required knowledge of marine macro-organism lifestyles, characteristics, identification to genus or species where possible, and identification of trace fossils, what organism caused them and how it came to be. Findings were photo documented were complied with interpretations in a report authored by Ms. Cochrane. \r\n\r\nEnvironmental risks and benefits of net-zero energy residential homes.  In 2011, Ms. Cochrane researched environmental impacts of several new residential constructions designed to use combinations of alternative energy options such as solar, wind, geothermal, paired with top-of-industry energy efficient construction methods to reduce dependence on traditional energy sources to zero. She compiled her findings into a report to be used in a presentation on alternative energy options for future housing developments.\r\n\r\nPetrography of rocks of the Coast Arc Complex, Porteau Cove area, B.C.  In 2010, Ms. Cochrane developed a petrographic study of rocks sampled from north to south along the Porteau Cover region of the Coast Arc Complex in an effort to identify mineralogical changes during geologic development of the complex. She planned and coordinated fieldwork including locations of data collection and methods to ensure validity, and performed the fieldwork over several days. Rock samples collected in the field were brought to a lab facility at Western Washington University, where Ms. Cochrane produced multiple thin sections for mineral identification and description, documenting findings using a Zeiss polarizing photomicroscope. Findings were compiled into a detailed report and presentation.\r\n\r\nOrigin of clay minerals in sandstone of the Eocene Chuckanut Formation, northwestern Washington.  As part of a team in 2010, Ms. Cochrane developed a study of sedimentary rocks sampled from the Chuckanut Formation in Bellingham, Washington in order to determine possible origins of clay minerals identified. Ms. Cochrane performed the sample collection in the field and lab analysis using rock powdering equipment, a Rigaku X-ray diffractometer and a Cambridge stereoscan scanning electron microscope. Results and interpretations were compiled into a report and presentation delivered at a stratigraphy and sedimentation meeting at Western Washington University. \r\n\r\n\r\nGeologic structures mapping of California-Nevada-Utah regions of the Cordillera.  Ms. Cochrane spent 6 weeks mapping geologic structures and rock types of several areas of the Cordillera in 2011, producing three geologic maps with cross-sections showing interpretations of structures at depth. These materials were incorporated as field evidence into a report she authored on the large scale geologic history of the Cordillera, with focus on the geologic processes displayed by smaller-scale structures. Included in the report was full photo documentation of rock types, mineral identifications, small and large scale structures, fossil identifications and visible relationships between strata with interpretations for each. \r\n\r\n  \r\nStatus and opportunities for remediation of coral reefs offshore of Puerto Rico.  In 2011, Ms. Cochrane compiled findings of coral reef decline offshore of Puerto Rico from five studies conducted in the area over ten years. She developed interpretations based off of those results for possible causes of the decline including, increased sedimentation of ocean water and increased nutrient content from agricultural runoff, related to an increase in urbanization of Puerto Rico.

As one of the three crew leads, Ms. Vance was responsible for developing the weekly itinerary for her and her junior crew member, designed to maximize sampling efficiency and to adhere to a sampling schedule developed during the project design. Any sampling issues or discrepancies encountered in the field were recorded and communicated with the survey design team to discuss any potential survey modifcations necessary. Ms. Vance was responsible for organizing data collected by her crew, managing and delegating data entry tasks between herself and the junior crew member, and following strict quality control protocols to ensure the integrity and accuracy of all field data collected. Upon completion of field operations, Ms.Vance supported the writing of the draft report regarding data collection and management procedures.\r\n\r\nSoil parameters observed included soil temperature and texture, excavation and description of soil profile, determination of the presence or absence of organic horizons and depth if present, and identification of any disturbance (soil compaction) or erosion features on site. Back in the lab, Ms.Vance tested the soils for the macronutrients Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium. Native vegetation was identified to genus while non-native/invasive species were identified to species, and canopy, where present was recorded and identified to genus as well. Other related vegetative parameters recorded included size and decay class of coarse woody debris and snags where present.\r\n\r\nUplands vegetation and soils monitoring \r\nMs. Vance led crews on front and backcountry trips to establish long-term standardized protocols for monitoring soils and vegetation of the 11 national parks and monuments within the Sonoran Desert Network, located in the southwestern United States. Crews recorded terrestrial vegetation cover for common perennial species and for uncommon and non-native species (both annual and perennial); terrestrial soil cover described by substrate classes, and soil aggregate stability described based on a standardized scale of 1-6;  cryptobiotic soil crust cover and frequency and morphological group; and landscape characteristics related to both geomorphological and erosion features. Soil samples collected from each monitoring plot were brought back to the lab and analyzed for bulk density, total carbon, pH, particle size distribution and electrical conductivity. Upon completion of fieldwork, Ms.Vance worked with colleagues to ensure all of the data was enetered quickly and accurately implementing a quality control pathway in which at least two employees reviewed the data before sending it off for final review to a higher official. She also took charge of compiling, entering and organizing all of the soils data generated in the lab. She built a database to organize and manage the data and then geo-referenced all of the data to create soil data maps for the National Parks and Monuments within the network using ArcGIS.\r\n\r\nStream quality monitoring in the Sonoran Desert\r\nMs.Vance worked with senior aquatic ecologists to characterize the ecological and hydrological conditions of rivers located in culturally significant National Parks and Monuments of the desert Southwest. She took water quality measurements that  examined turbidity (suspended solids), pH, electrical conductivity, toxins, microbial populations, and selected inorganic nutrients. Water quantity was established through monthly, seasonal and annual stream discharge measurements of means and totals. Channel morphology and channel habitat was determined through the mapping of channel cross-sections, slope, sinuosity and continuity. As part of the ecological condition assessments, she conducted riparian vegetation surveys to describe the vegetation communities, including both native and non-native species, in tems of the their structure and recruitment status. Native and non-native fish abundance and richness were recorded. Macroinvertebrates were collected to determine taxa abundance and richness as well. \r\n\r\nInventory and quality assessment of seeps, springs, and tinajas of the Sonoran Desert\r\nAs part of a field team, Ms.Vance conducted surveys characterizing critical surface water sources in the Sonoran Desert and Apach Highlands ecoregions, critical to supporting flora and fauna in the area. Seeps, springs and tinajas were located and ground-truthed based on old park records, interviews with hikers and park personnel, and through the analysis of aerial photographs. At each of the various water sources, Ms.Vance and her team collected data concerning the water dynamics, quality and persistence of water throughout the year. Additionally, aquatic invertebrates were collected to evaluate community composition of these localized water sources. Each seep, spring and tinaja was mapped and recorded using GPS units. Where possible, water depth, weatted area and soil moisture data was collected. Any perennial riparian vegetation observed was recorded by species to describe community composition and species abundance of common spring species. \r\n\r\n\r\nEPA Sub-contractor for Disaster Debris Removal post Hurrican Katrina\r\nOversaw deactivation and demolition (D&D) of homes damaged by the 2005 Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans and surrounding parishes deemed to contain asbestos. She followed strict protocols to ensure that all demolition crews were successfully upholding the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and EPA requirements regarding the proper handling and disposal of asbestos containing materials (ACM). Any violations by demolition crews were recorded and reported to the EPA.\r\n\r\nRELATED FIELD EXPERIENCE\r\nMaster’s thesis research: “An examination of the soils supporting Hackelia venusta, Washington State’s most endangered species”\r\nIn conjunction with the U.S. Forest Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife and the Washington State Department of Natural Resources, helped in the design and installation of field research techniques to carefully establish the characteristics of the soil supporting Hackelia venusta, an endangered species endemic to Washington state. Four site locations were established within the known population of H.venusta and soil pits were excavated at each site. Within each soil pit, descriptions of soil horizons and depths were recorded (including continuity, color, structure and aggregation), bulk density was collected where possible and bulk soil samples were collected by depth until continuous or nearly continuous bedrock was reached. Samples were taken back to the lab and analyzed for physical (bulk density, particle size distribution, and color) and chemical (pH, total carbon, plant-available nitrogen and phosphorus, cation exchange capacity and percent base saturation) parameters. Continued monitoring efforts included monthly visits to four site locations in eastern Washington to gather data concerning soil temperature and erosion. Upon completion of field work, Ms.Vance wrote a comprehensive report on her work including a thorough literature review, detailed description of methods, and an in-depth analysis of her results. The report was submitted to authorities at the U.S. Forest Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife offices for their records.\r\n\r\nQuantifying the fate of applied N fertilizer over a one-year period in Douglas-Fir plantations using stable isotope technology\r\nAssisted in execution of NSF-funded project through both the installation and monitoring of field sites located in Douglas-fir plantations distributed throughout the Pacific northwest. Ten field sites were established and 5 plots were set up within each site, each plot being centered around a single target tree. Fieldwork included establishment of 100 m2 circular plot, and within each plot the application of nitrogen fertilizers, DBH measurments for all perennial, woody species within the plot, ocular estimates of vegetation cover by species,  collection of soil cores down to 60 cm depth, tree cores from the target tree, foliage from target tree from the top 1/3 of the tree in an effort to capture the newest growth, and forest floor samples. Foliage samples were dried, divided into age classes, and analyzed for 15N using isotope-ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS). Forest floor samples were dried and weighed and analyzed for bulk volume and 15N using IRMS. Soil cores were dried, sieved, and prepared for 15N analysis by IRMS technology. In addition to the fieldwork component of this project, Ms.Vance supported the writing of status reports and gave multiple presentations to discuss the project and anticipated results at conferences, including the annual Soil Science Society of America conference and the North American Forest Soils Conference.\r\n	2015-02-27 05:25:09.045132	2015-02-27 05:25:09.045132	599

For the U.S. Department of Energy, analyzed one of the largest environmental data sets known to consider potential impacts from federal facility operations over the last 50 years and those planned for the next 50.  Potential impacts considered involved those to resources and uses of concern to three Tribes in the Pacific Northwest including those protected by Treaties, e.g., fisheries.  Analysis formed the basis of a clear and reasonable approach to potential injury assessment in a project running high with emotionalism.  \r\n\r\nMarine Mammal Monitoring Plan, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  Collected data for a six month marine mammal monitoring project for the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration counting whales and dolphins. In the Eastern Tropical Pacific.  Spent six months at sea conducting line transects for whales and dolphins in the eastern tropical pacific off of a 200 foot vessel. Assisted with strip transect survey of seabirds and small boat captures of sea turtles for distribution study. Also, conducted net tows for fish and assisted with CTD (device measuring conductivity, temperature, and depth) deployments.\r\n\r\nSupport for the Upper Columbia River Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS) and Related NRDA Matters at Superfund Site.  Mr. Mason is providing biological and statistical support to the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation (Colville Tribes) on the Upper Columbia River, Washington in relation to ongoing RI/FS and related NRDA matters.  Support includes analyzing previous studies and collected data; developing statistically defensible beach and sediment sampling designs; providing comments on surface water and fish tissue quality assurance project plans (QAPPs) and sampling assurance plans (SAPs) and other documents developed by the responsible parties; and supporting human health risk assessment.\r\n\r\nSupport on NRDA Matter at Superfund Site.  Mr. Mason provided support for an ongoing NRDA matter involving hazardous substance releases to soil, groundwater, sediments, and surface water.  Support included providing advice on appropriate background levels for purposes of injury determination and quantification and assisting in calculating injuries to both abiotic and biotic resources using media benchmarks and GIS mapping techniques.  Project completion relied heavily on interpretation of CERCLA and NRDA regulations as well as the application of statistical and database management principles.\r\n\r\nStatistical and Study Design Support for NRDA Matter in Maine.  Mr. Mason provided support to the Maine Department of Environmental Protection for an NRDA matter involving an abandoned marine oil terminal in Hampden, Maine.  His support included analysis and assessment of biological receptors and exposure pathways, contaminant data, and creation of a study design to adequately assess potential injuries related to releases of oil in a riparian environment with heavy tidal influences.  Relevant previous studies were evaluated to collect the necessary data on biological receptors in the area.  These data were used to inform the NRDA process and evaluate the potential risk to various ecological receptors.\r\n\r\nData collection for NRDA Common Murre Restoration Project.  Mr. Mason assisted with data collection on a Common Murre restoration project on Devil’s Slide Rock off of the California coast.  Common Murres were counted from photographs and observed from shore.  The project was part of an NRDA settlement concerning an oil spill off of the California coast in 1986 and subsequent restoration.\r\n\r\nQuestionnaire Survey Design for Assessing Risk to Colville Tribe Members.  Mr. Mason assisted in developing a resource usage questionnaire for Colville Tribal Members.  The questionnaire was designed to assist the Colville Tribes in assessing potential risk to tribal members from fish and wildlife consumption and the use of various river resources in connection with tribal rites and ceremonies.  He reviewed the questionnaire for potential biases and to ensure that it was targeting the appropriate population segment and provided advice on appropriate sample size of those interviewed.  He also evaluated fish tissue contaminant data to assist the Colville Tribes in developing guidelines for consumption of certain species.\r\n\r\nDistribution and Abundance of Seabirds in the Southern California Bight.  Mr. Mason collected data for and authored a peer-reviewed article presenting aerial survey data collected off of the southern California coast.  Three years of surveys were conducted at sea and along island and mainland coastlines from fixed-wing aircraft from the California/Mexico border to central California and 100 km out to sea.  Seasonal maps using GIS were generated for individual species and the study was accepted for publication in Studies in Avian Biology.  Mr. Mason also counted breeding seabirds from photographs to assess breeding success and population status of pelicans and cormorants on the California Channel Islands.  He coordinated with several state (e.g., California Department of Fish and Game) and federal agencies (e. g., the US Geological Survey, Minerals Management Service, US Fish and Wildlife Service, and US Navy) and local landowners to facilitate access to restricted areas.\r\n\r\nStatistical Analysis Regarding Breeding Ashy Storm-Petrels.    Mr. Mason collected and statistically analyzed data on breeding Ashy Storm-Petrels in several southern California offshore caves.  Caves were visited several times a year for multiple years and storm-petrel adults, chicks and eggs were counted and evaluated to determine breeding status and success and to document instances of predation.  Data analysis indicated a stable population of storm-petrels existed with fluctuations attributable to survey effort and predator interactions.\r\n\r\nAnalysis of Data on Mercury Levels in Benthic Infauna.  While obtaining a Master’s degree in epidemiology/biostatistics collected and analyzed data on mercury levels in benthic infauna of California’s southern San Francisco Bay. Operated trucks and small boats to access sites and trained new workers in field methods and identification techniques using microscopes. \r\n\r\nStudy on Distribution and Abundance of Seabirds and Marine Mammals on Monterey Bay.  Designed a study to assess changes in distribution and abundance of seabirds in Monterey Bay, California. Made statistical comparisons to historical data and found population number increases in Sooty Shearwaters and Western Grebes and decreases in Common Murres and Cassin’s Auklets. Also, conducted shore surveys for dead birds to assess use as estimator of at-sea abundances and impacts of gill-net fishing in the bay. Found Common Murres to be the most susceptible species to gill-netting and shore surveys to be poor indicators of at-sea abundance for most species. \r\n\r\nNorthern Fur Seal Study, Pribilof Islands, Alaska.  Conducted a population census and studied the impact of solid waste and other human development on juvenile Northern fur seals in the Pribilof Islands.  Work was conducted on behalf of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).  The project involved field work over two one-month periods including fur seal observations, captures, tagging, and freeing from entanglements (e.g., fishing lines and packing bands).  The population census consisted of a pup mark-recapture study involving the entire Pribilof population. \r\n	2015-02-27 05:25:09.202267	2015-02-27 05:25:09.202267	600
